Older people who have a general anaesthetic while undergoing surgery are 35% more likely to develop dementia years afterwards as a result, according to new research.
The study has reopened the question of whether anaesthetic agents may potentially affect the brains of children or elderly patients, as some evidence suggests.
Research from France being presented on Sunday at a conference of anaesthetists identifies postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a common delirium-like complication of major surgery in older people, as a likely cause of dementia that develops some years later. Some scientists believe POCD may be associated with dementia because of a common pathological mechanism involving the amyloid beta peptide.
Amyloid plaques are found in the brains of those suffering from Alzheimer's, by far the most common form of dementia, as well as dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Previous studies have suggested that certain anaesthetics may promote the inflammation of neural tissues and so lead to either POCD or Alzheimer's disease precursors, including amyloid plaques and neurofibriliary tangles. But the authors, led by Dr Fran√ßois Sztark of the University of Bordeaux, say it is still uncertain whether POCD can be a precursor to dementia.
Their research used data from the 3C study, which began examining the health of 9,294 people aged 65 or over in the French cities of Bordeaux, Dijon and Montpellier from 1999 in order to assess the risk of dementia and decline in cognitive function linked to vascular risk factors. Participants were checked two, four, seven and 10 years later. Each time the 7,008 patients without dementia were asked if they had had either a general or local anaesthetic since the last check-up. After two years, 2,309 (33%) had undergone one in that time, of which 1,333 (19%) were general and 948 (14%) local. In total 632 participants developed dementia over eight years.
Sztark's team found that, at the two-year follow-up, 37% of those with dementia had been exposed to anaesthesia, compared with 32% of those who had not experienced neurodegeneration. While 22% of the patients with dementia had had a general anaesthetic, 19% of those free of dementia had done so.
A summary of their findings, which are being unveiled at the annual meeting of the European Society of Anaesthesiology, states: "After adjustment, participants with at least one general anaesthesia over the follow-up had a 35% increased risk of developing a dementia compared with participants without anaesthesia." That risk is for general anaesthesia, not all anaesthesia, they stressed.
Sztark said the authors had a "95% confidence interval" in that level of heightened risk of a condition which 800,000 Britons already have, a number which is expected to rise to over one million by 2021 due to the ageing population. The true risk is between 11% and 63%, he added.
"These results are in favour of an increased risk for dementia several years after general anaesthesia." Health professionals should, he said, be aware of the possibility of POCD when deciding how to manage elderly patients who are being fully anaesthetised.
Dementia organisations responded cautiously. Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "This is early data and given the complexity of the findings we need to await the full peer-reviewed publication before fully interpreting the results. Research into the impact of anaesthetics on dementia is challenging because it can be very difficult to tease out cause and effect. Dementia is caused by several brain diseases, many of which arise from a complex mix of genetic and environmental factors."
Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: "The early results from this study support the view that anaesthesia may increase risk of developing dementia but questions still remain about why this is the case and whether other factors could also have a role to play."

Davey: "Probably out of the question" that Bryce Harper plays this weekend in Atlanta. DL becoming a possibility.
‚Äî Adam Kilgore (@AdamKilgoreWP) May 31, 2013

Harper's sore knee has kept him on the bench since May 26. Skipping the weekend would bring the total of days missed to seven, so the Nats would be nearly halfway to a 15-day disabled list stint while playing shorthanded. Given that their next six games are against NL East opponents Atlanta and New York, you'd think they would want to have a full complement of players.
As it is, things have not been going well for the Nats -- since winning five in a row from May 4 through May 10, they've gone 7-12 and are hitting .225/.283/.363 with an average of 3.3 runs per game in that span. Since Harper sat they've gone 1-3 with an odd
.241/.257/.481 line -- they've hit eight home runs in 133 at-bats, but haven't been able to get anyone on base overall.
There's no replacing a Harper, but the Nationals have other problems, such as Danny Espinosa trying to play through a broken wrist -- he's hitting .162/.194/.284. Infielder Anthony Rendon is tearing things up at Double-A (.330/.473/.625) and the Nats may have to give him a real shot before long. Outfielder Jayson Werth and catcher Wilson Ramos also remain on the disabled list.

Although the Boy Scouts voted to allow gay scouts lost week, the ban on gay leaders within the group has yet to be lifted. The group's exclusion of gay adults from participating is the main reason California lawmakers believe the BSA's decision didn't go far enough.

Here's what Sen. Ricardo Lara said on the Senate floor:

"4H and the Girl Scouts don't discriminate. They don't exclude LGBT or leaders just because for the simple fact of being who they are. Being the person God made them. Neither do the Boys and Girls Club, or the YMCA. Now, besides being the right thing to do, under current law, these groups' inclusiveness and commitment to equality make them eligible to tax exemptions, exemptions supported financially by all Californians. At the other end of the spectrum, we have the Boy Scouts of America‚Ä¶ an organization with a central flaw so profound that until it is fully fixed, it means that they are out of line with the values of California and should be ineligible for a tax benefit paid for, again, by all Californians."

If signed into law, the bill would force the Boy Scouts to pay the state taxes, effectively causing Boy Scouts to pay taxes on membership, donations, and fundraising activities.

(via Rotoworld.)
Werder says the issue stems from Cruz's asking price, thought to be around $8 million a year, compared to the other elite slot receivers across the league.

Giants coverage at Big Blue View

Here's Werder laying out Cruz's situation, compared to one of the game's best, Denver Broncos wideout Wes Welker:

"The issue here is that Cruz is one of the dominant slot receivers in football. But none of the slot receivers in the NFL rank among the top-salaried receivers. It's all outside receivers. So he's put in a situation with his agent Tom Condon, they've gotta convince the Giants that he should make more money than say, Wes Welker."

Welker is set to make $6 million per season over his two-year deal with Denver.
The leverage on Cruz's side? With him missing organized team activities, along with wideout Hakeem Nicks, the Giants are practicing with Rueben Randle as the team's No. 1 wideout. The other thing is, as Werder notes, Cruz is one of the best slot guys in the league: in 2012, he caught 86 passes for 1,092 yards and 10 touchdowns, which followed up his breakout 2011 season where he caught 82 balls for 1,536 yards and nine touchdowns.

One of them, the Ocala Star-Banner reports, was eating beef jerky. The women told cops they were attempting to cross an item off their bucket list. (Presumably stealing, or maybe just "getting swimsuits for free somehow," or maybe eating beef jerky in Walmart in which case the shoplifting was really not warranted.)
The bikini bandits, 36-year-old Andrea Mobley and 38-year-old Jennifer Morrow, explained to police that they were childhood friends who had recently reconnected and come up with a bucket list of activties they wanted to do together before their bones turned to dust. Item one: commemorate their reunion with some petty theft. The petty theft their lives would have been incomplete without performing (hence: bucket list). To Walmart!

A store security officer told police that she saw Morrow browse the racks and stuff some bathing suits into her purse while Mobley ate beef jerky. Mobley then went into a fitting room and put a swimsuit on under her clothes (and over her belly, full now, of beef jerky). Then the women attempted to exit the store without paying.

Here's how the Star-Banner describes their mindset and dietary habits:

‚Äú[Mobley] said putting on the suit was ‚Äòan impulsive thing,‚Äô as was eating the beef jerky.‚Äù

People. You have gotten out of control with your bucket lists.
You see Morgan Freeman do something in a movie once, and all of a sudden you‚Äôre eating dinner at the Chevre d'Or in France and you‚Äôre wearing an all white suit and living in a big white room and you‚Äôre driving Miss Daisy. Just because Morgan Freeman does something, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a good idea for you to do it.

The problem with bucket lists is that they are not consecrated documents that trump the law of the land. You know what ‚Äústealing‚Äù is, in addition to item No. 8 on your bucket list? Illegal. You might feel like you‚Äôre not really stealing‚Äîyou do have enough money to pay for this knickknack, after all you‚Äôre just pocketing it to cross a number off the ol‚Äô bucket list!‚Äîbut most stores do not have a ‚Äúvaluable life experience‚Äù loophole when it comes to prosecuting shoplifters.
Of course you want to relish the power that comes from feeling a victim‚Äôs lifeless body slump back against your own or know the rush that comes from setting a stranger‚Äôs house on fire. We all want that. But these activities are illegal and, hence, good things to leave off your bucket list.
Morrow and Mobley were both arrested and taken to jail, where their bond was set at $250 each. Morrow told a judge that stealing the swimsuits was ‚Äúnot something I wanted to do, but we both decided to do it.‚Äù Mobley told the Star-Banner it was Morrow's idea to steal.
Hopefully the next item on their bucket list was ‚Äúbreak up a lifelong friendship.‚Äù If so, they're right on pace.</div></a><a href="http://world.time.com/2013/05/31/simon-bolivar-the-latin-american-hero-many-americans-dont-know/" data-url="http://world.time.com/2013/05/31/simon-bolivar-the-latin-american-hero-many-americans-dont-know/" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="f62119db19456671fc6af8927142bd46ad2371f2" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="238"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/f62119db19456671fc6af8927142bd46ad2371f2"></figure><div><h2>News - world.time.com</h2><h1>Sim√≥n Bol√≠var: The Latin American Hero Many Americans Don‚Äôt Know</h1>Sim√≥n Bol√≠var lived a sweeping, epic life. The Latin American independence hero swanned around the salons of revolutionary-era Paris, skulked in the Guyanese jungle and enlisted the aid of roughriding cowboys and mercenary privateers, among others, in his campaigns. He wooed myriad women while remaining utterly devoted to the principles of the Enlightenment. He was born into one of the highest rungs of the Spanish colonial elite ‚Äî a plantation-owning family in Caracas ‚Äî but would be the man who would go on to liberate Spanish America‚Äôs slaves. He is lionized now across the continent as the courageous general who won Latin America‚Äòs wars of independence, but he died in 1830, at the age of 47, humbled by failures and derided by numerous critics. Bol√≠var‚Äôs many-chambered life is the subject of a recent critically acclaimed biography, Bol√≠var: American Liberator, by the Peruvian-American writer Marie Arana. Arana spoke to TIME about this titan of the western hemisphere and how more people in the U.S. should know his story. The book‚Äôs subtitle is&nbsp;American Liberator, a phrase that might conjure a different figure in American minds than Bol√≠var. How do you compare him with George Washington? That‚Äôs hard to do. It‚Äôs like living on different planets, in a way. Bol√≠var‚Äôs task was far more complicated. [He fought over] an area of land that was seven times larger than the American colonies and over terrain ‚Äî the Andes, the jungles ‚Äî that was far more difficult than the rolling hills of New England. Just in terms of a military feat it was quite extraordinary what he did. The public regard for Bol√≠var&nbsp;wherever he went was incredible. He inspired the masses to throw over the colonial structure. And he did it republic after republic, until six emerged. Bol√≠var&nbsp;had enormous flaws, he made terrible mistakes. He would execute one person for treason and then let a very treasonous general get away with the same thing. He was uneven and trying to make it up as he went along. When you‚Äôre operating like that ‚Äî&nbsp;everything impromptu ‚Äî&nbsp;it‚Äôs.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://www.vice.com/en_se/read/drones-and-blood-are-the-price-of-nuclear-power" data-url="http://www.vice.com/en_se/read/drones-and-blood-are-the-price-of-nuclear-power" class="item" style="width:628px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="dbb68a1ef9953175c7f155b8ed66542dd542fa56" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="240"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/xl/hq/dbb68a1ef9953175c7f155b8ed66542dd542fa56"></figure><div><h2>News - vice.com</h2><h1>Greg Palast's Column: Blood for Uranium Is the Sequel to Blood for Oil</h1>The author speaking to Acoma Pueblo Councillor David Vallo about uranium mining contamination.

Put these three things together:

1 ‚Äì Despite President Barack Obama‚Äôs public announcement that he‚Äôs swearing off his addiction to drone strikes, The Drone Ranger has authorised a new drone base in the African nation of Niger.&nbsp;

2 ‚Äì In May 2010, Obama sent Congress a bill to purchase body armour and landmine-proof vehicles for our troops in Afghanistan. Hidden in the quickly-passed emergency measure: a $9 billion (¬£5.9 billion) loan guarantee for constructing nuclear power plants in Texas, Georgia, Maryland and South Carolina.

3 ‚Äì Last week, two suicide attacks killed at least 30 at mine sites in Niger. The attacks were claimed by the Islamist group Those Who Sign with Blood, joined by the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa, an al-Qaeda affiliate.

Niger doesn‚Äôt seem much like a place worth fighting over. Its people are so poor they can‚Äôt afford a coastline, just desert surrounded by more desert. They survive on 2,300 calories a day, though not for very long ‚Äì most don‚Äôt live to 55.

From the air (I‚Äôve only flown over it), it looks like Death Valley on a bad day ‚Äì a sand-blasted wasteland, fried and desertified.&nbsp;&nbsp;

But it‚Äôs what‚Äôs beneath the desert, invisible from the sky, that makes Niger the nation ‚Äì if not its people ‚Äì very rich indeed. Niger is the world‚Äôs fourth largest producer of uranium, the irradiating mineral at the heart of every nuclear power plant.

Last week‚Äôs attacks on the French-owned uranium mines were portrayed in the New York Times as spillover from the conflicts in Mali and Libya.

Merde de taureau! If anything, it is the war over Niger‚Äôs uranium that spilled over to Mali. In September 2010, long before the Islamist attacks in Mali and a year before Libya blew up, al-Qaeda attacked the mines, kidnapping a French engineer and his wife. The hunt for their captors and France‚Äôs need to protect its mines and resource reserves is what set off the Franco-Qaeda war in the Sahel.&nbsp;

Obama is backing the French resource occupation army. Note that his decision to base US drones in Niger ‚Äì there are many base options in the giant region ‚Äì came before this last attack.

Obama knows: if the US wants hot rocks, he has to send in the hot rockets.

Get used to it. If you liked blood-for-oil wars, you won‚Äôt have to wait long for the sequel: blood for uranium.

The Niger mines‚Äô principal owner, Areva, may have a French accent, but the Obama administration would know Areva as the US nuclear power industry‚Äôs number one supplier. Moreover, Areva obtained one of the four coveted loan guarantees from Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúemergency‚Äù Afghan war chest. While Areva‚Äôs license for that reactor, sited in Maryland, is on hold until it finds a US-based partner, Areva remains a crucial source of the uranium fuel rods needed by the operators of all US plants. The US government also relies on Areva to fabricate MOX fuel. Areva‚Äôs MOX is made from uranium ore products mixed with plutonium from Soviet warheads purchased by the US.

Obama knows, but will never say, what I‚Äôm telling you now: Without a US military force in Niger, there will be no nuclear plant in Maryland, no MOX mix to burn up those old Russkie nukes.

The nuclear industry‚Äôs frontmen tell us that nuclear power will end our dependence on Mideast oil. If John McCain, the Senator from Arizona, gets his way, the US will build 200 new nuclear reactors at a cost of ten trillion dollars. The result would replace our dependence on OPEC‚Ä¶ with dependence on Russia, Kazakhstan and Niger.&nbsp;

What‚Äôs wrong with that? After all, President George W Bush said he ‚Äúlooked [Vladimir Putin] in the eye [and] found him to be very ‚Ä¶ trustworthy‚Äù.

I admit, I‚Äôve never looked into Putin‚Äôs eyes ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt dare. But to make the lights of Baltimore dependent on Vlad the Impaler of Chechens seems, well, ill-advised.&nbsp;

And Kazakhstan? That‚Äôs worth a story by itself. (Watch this space.)

That leaves Areva‚Äôs Niger supply, if we‚Äôre willing to kill for it.&nbsp;

Niger‚Äôs capital, by the way, is Niamey. I thought I‚Äôd give you a head start on most Americans and Britons who don‚Äôt learn the names of a nation‚Äôs capital until the arrival of the 101st Airborne and the 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. (Think Saigon, Mogadishu, Kabul.)

But war for uranium might well be worth the blood if you listen to ersatz environmentalists, such as James Lovelock, who tell us nuclear energy is ‚Äúgreen‚Äù, unlike, say, natural gas.

I would invite Dr Lovelock or any other greenie lovesick for radioactive energy to the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico this coming week when these Native Americans who once supplied our uranium will be tested for the cancers and other illnesses that mining the ore brought them.&nbsp;

In 2008, for BBC Newsnight, I went to the pueblo following the indictment of local white politicians charged with stealing hundreds of Native ballots. Tribal Councillor David Vallo explained that the pueblo was attempting to vote down the reopening of the nearby uranium mine. The mine, he asserted, did as good a job as Custer in wiping out Indians. ‚ÄúWe lost a lot of good people on account of their health.‚Äù He then added, ‚ÄúYou know, that's irradiation ‚Äì uranium is irradiation.‚Äù

Yes, I do know that uranium means irradiation ‚Äì but it‚Äôs green irradiation.

Vallo noted that uranium contaminated their water supply and the mine run-off killed their crops. And that‚Äôs good, because if something grew, you wouldn‚Äôt want to eat it.

To white environmentalists, those sculpted nuclear cooling towers do look quite clean. But to the black, Asian and Indigenous peoples who dig the ore, nuclear power‚Äôs low carbon footprint comes from heavy jackboots. For one example: France‚Äôs President Nicolas Sarkozy has backed Niger‚Äôs President Mamadou Tandja, despite desolving the nation‚Äôs constitution, after the de facto dictator agreed to open a new mine site to Areva. France‚Äôs Canal 24 reports that Taureg tribesmen ‚Äì the group that would form the backbone of the insurgency in Niger and Mali&nbsp;‚Äì were cleansed from the mining area.

Here‚Äôs a photo of Areva‚Äôs mine in Niger. Not a lot of green there. Greenpeace has reported abysmal working conditions at the mines, as well as contamination of the surrounding towns.

The chorus of Peggy Seeger‚Äôs song "Springfield Mine Disaster" goes, "Bone and blood is the price of coal."

The theme song of ‚Äúgreen‚Äù nuclear energy should be, "Drones and blood is the price of uranium."

According to Yahoo! Sports' Adrian Wojnarowski, Drew has agreed to become the next head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks:

The 55-year-old Drew spent three seasons with the Hawks, compiling a 128-102 regular-season record and making the playoffs in each year. Atlanta went 44-38 this past season en route to earning the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. The club was ousted from the first round in six games by the Indiana Pacers.
Drew will replace interim head coach Jim Boylan, who was not retained. The Bucks went 38-44 during the regular season, earning the No. 8 seed in the East before being swept by the Miami Heat in the conference quarterfinals.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://timesofindia.feedsportal.com/c/33039/f/533917/s/2ca56912/l/0Ltimesofindia0Bindiatimes0N0Cworld0Cmiddle0Eeast0CSyrias0EAssad0Econfident0Eof0Evictory0Ein0Ecivil0Ewar0Carticleshow0C20A3610A740Bcms/story01.htm" data-url="http://timesofindia.feedsportal.com/c/33039/f/533917/s/2ca56912/l/0Ltimesofindia0Bindiatimes0N0Cworld0Cmiddle0Eeast0CSyrias0EAssad0Econfident0Eof0Evictory0Ein0Ecivil0Ewar0Carticleshow0C20A3610A740Bcms/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="9f33c90f3d01fddecc2f4ff42199188ab64ec86a" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="244"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/9f33c90f3d01fddecc2f4ff42199188ab64ec86a"></figure><div><h2>News - timesofindia.indiatimes.com</h2><h1>Assad 'confident of victory in civil war'</h1>Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview broadcast on Thursday that he is "confident in victory" in his country's civil war, and he warned that Damascus would retaliate for any future Israeli airstrike on his territory.</div></a><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/ap-source-bucks-set-hire-larry-drew-215403486.html" data-url="http://news.yahoo.com/ap-source-bucks-set-hire-larry-drew-215403486.html" class="item" style="width:308px; height:148px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="27dff7e17a1228e0346364c8aa3c4f9b8137f5b2" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="242"><div><h2>Sports - news.yahoo.com</h2><h1>AP Source: Bucks set to hire Larry Drew</h1>A person with knowledge of the decision tells The Associated Press the Milwaukee Bucks have reached an agreement with former Atlanta Hawks coach Larry Drew to hire him as their new coach.</div></a><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FactMagazineMusicAndArt/~3/nWNcX087VWU/" data-url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/FactMagazineMusicAndArt/~3/nWNcX087VWU/" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="0ff3f99b0507feccb0cd5d94ebc99a6fd6480796" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="243"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/0ff3f99b0507feccb0cd5d94ebc99a6fd6480796"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - factmag.com</h2><h1>Possible art for Kanye West‚Äôs Yeezus leaks</h1>The melted gold motif might have been replaced with something more spartan.

Franchitti earned his 31st-career Indy car pole on Friday afternoon, setting the bar in the Firestone Fast Six with a lap time of 1 minute, 19.331 seconds around 13-turn temporary street course, during the 10-minute final session.
Franchitti had believed himself an unlikely choice to set fast time and was slowest in a Friday practice session that was marred by changing weather conditions, so he's thrilled with the result.
"I think I was a longshot to get through Q1; I did four laps in practice this morning," Franchitti said. "It was interesting obviously with the rain in the first session, getting through in that, and then the drying track and fully drive in the end, so we had all the conditions there.
"I have to thank the engineering group. We had a really tough Indianapolis and to back with a pole is great, obviously with a 10-spot grid penalty. I'll do the best from where we start."
The pole was Franchitti's second of the season and tied Sebastien Bourdais for seventh all-time. They are both one behind Michael Andretti. Friday's pole was also Franchitt's first in seven attempts at Belle Isle.
EJ Viso was second (1:19.557) for Andretti Autosport, tying his best-career qualifying effort from last month in Brazil. As a result of the Franchitti penalty, Viso will assume the first starting spot for Saturday's race. Joining him on the front row will be road course ace Mike Conway, driving for Dale Coyne Racing in just his second start of the season.
James Jakes, Ryan Hunter-Reay and Alex Tagliani completed the Firestone Fast Six.
Time trials for the Sunday race will take place six hours before the start of the Saturday race. All cars will participate in one of two groups for 12 minutes each, with five minutes of guaranteed green-flag activity. Group 1 will consist of even-numbered positions on the practice time sheet, while odd-numbered positions will comprise Group 2.
The pole for the Sunday race will be awarded to the best overall lap time in the qualifying session with the remainder of the cars in the pole-sitter's group occupying the odd-numbered starting positions, beginning with third.
Cars in the other group with occupy the even-numbered starting positions.
Complete qualifying results from Race No. 1 knockout qualifying can be found below. Note: This is not a starting lineup as Franchitti, Charlie Kimball, Josef Newgarden and Graham Rahal will each receive 10-spot grid penalties.

Reports surfaced earlier in the week that the Bucks had narrowed their coaching search down to three candidates with Houston Rockets assistant Kelvin Sampson and Los Angeles Lakers assistant Steve Clifford joining Drew on their list of finalists. Once Clifford agreed to become coach of the Charlotte Bobcats, the Bucks presumably felt some pressure to complete their search.
This season, Drew led the Atlanta Hawks to a 44-38 record and the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference. Atlanta was eliminated in six games by the Indiana Pacers in the opening round of the playoffs. The Bucks are replacing interim coach Jim Boylan, who was fired after being swept by the Miami Heat in the first round.
Drew had served as head coach of the Hawks since 2010 and began his coaching career in the NBA as an assistant with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1992.

Sports.
Ujiri, who won the NBA's Executive of the Year honors this season, will return to his roots in Toronto, where he was an assistant GM from 2008-2010. He will reportedly receive a five-year, $15 million deal in Toronto.
By all accounts, Ujiri did a tremendous job in his three years with Denver, keeping the Nuggets among the top teams in the Western Conference despite the traumatic departure of Carmelo Anthony in 2011.
However, despite his accomplishments, Ujiri was one of the lowest-paid GMs in the NBA this past season. While the Nuggets made an effort to retain him, it does not appear that they were willing to match Toronto's lucrative offer.
Ujiri will be walking into a difficult situation in Toronto, as Bryan Colangelo assembled a below-.500 team without much flexibility to maneuver under the salary cap going forward. He will not have a first round pick in the 2013 NBA Draft after it was traded to the Houston Rockets in a package for point guard Kyle Lowry last summer.

But no one seems to be asking the right question: "Is Animal Planet real?" New programming suggests it's not, and might instead be a figment of our cultural imagination. In fact, it's possible that Animal Planet with its shows about fake monsters, naughty animals, and gross bugs has just been trolling us all along. But let's take a look at the evidence:

Exhibit 1: Lost Tapes.

Here we have television show about people at Animal Planet who spent a lot of time and money creating shitty CGI versions of your worst nightmares. This is a fake show about fake tapes of fake fucking monsters.

Exhibit 2: Finding Bigfoot.

This is a show about hipsters looking for a fake monster based on fake videos that were probably also made by hipsters. This is a show about hipsters looking for hipster relics. And not at all, I might add, about animals.

Exhibit 3: Monsters Inside Me.

THIS SHOW IS 100% COMPLETELY FALSE. THERE ARE NO WORMS INSIDE OF YOUR BRAIN, THAT IS JUST YOUR BRAIN. Don't ever watch this show.

Exhibit 4: Cats 101.

This is literally a television show about types of house cats.

Exhibit 5: My Cat From Hell.

This is literally a television show about irritating house cats.

Exhibit 5a: My Cat From Hell: Kimba's Follow-Up.

"On top of everything, Kimba was actually putting a pretty huge dent into Michael and Liz's relationship." (Note: If a fucking HOUSE CAT is terrorizing your marriage, GET RID OF THE CAT. Give it to your mom. Take it back to the shelter. Put it down. Put it in the back yard and let it learn to catch birds. Put it in the freezer.)

Exhibit 6: Dogs 101.

See Exhibit 4.

Exhibit 7: Bad Dog!

This show is the same as My Cat From Hell, but with dogs. (And exclamation points! Because even bad dogs are cute and funny.)

Exhibit 8: Too Cute.

This is really just a livecam of someone's living room carpet that happens to have a cute baby animal on it.

Conclusion: Animal Planet is not a real television channel. Joke's on us for believing that a network channel completely devoted to things that don't talk could ever keep up with today's reality television market. Dogs don't throw tables at each other. Cats don't have catch phrases. Discovery Communications has been trolling us for years. Proceed accordingly.</div></a><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheGlobeAndMail-International/~3/R6xXGuIkyWQ/" data-url="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheGlobeAndMail-International/~3/R6xXGuIkyWQ/" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="ca30bb2a9ed686db445355bf987f1137cf6d4fd1" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="260"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/ca30bb2a9ed686db445355bf987f1137cf6d4fd1"></figure><div><h2>News - theglobeandmail.com</h2><h1>Turkish police stage dawn raid to break up peaceful Istanbul sit-in over tree removal</h1>Turkish riot police used tear gas and water cannon Friday to end a peaceful sit-in by hundreds of people trying to prevent trees from being uprooted in an Istanbul park.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:320px;"><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2013/5/31/4384648/mlb-crosstown-showdowns-local-ratings" data-url="http://www.sbnation.com/2013/5/31/4384648/mlb-crosstown-showdowns-local-ratings" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="04e024dd1992cb896a91d3951d1b33ad841c64d5" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="265"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/04e024dd1992cb896a91d3951d1b33ad841c64d5"></figure><div><h2>Sports - sbnation.com</h2><h1>MLB crosstown showdowns provide interesting local ratings</h1>One of the remaining interesting things about the various baseball series that pit crosstown, interleague rivals against one another (and let's face it, unless the two teams competing are both good, it's no longer novel) is that both teams' television broadcasts get pitted against one another. The ratings can not only be a sign of how activated various baseball fanbases are, but how well liked baseball broadcasts are. Since the game's available on two channels (three, in the case of a couple games on ESPN's Tuesday doubleheader slate) the people are free to choose what they want.
Now, in most cases, people are going to go to their local broadcaster no matter what, and the performance of a team will determine how things went, ratings-wise. Also something to keep an eye on: networks use multiple partners, usually one cable and one over-the-air station, to broadcast various games. In the case of the Cubs and White Sox, the two switched broadcasters each day of the Windy City showdown.
Anyway, A source provided me with some ratings data for this week's four crosstown showdowns (New York, Chicago, LA-Anaheim and the Bay Area) and they provided some interesting, if predictable (in most cases) data. Let's go market by market.
New York: It was a good weak for the long-suffering Metropolitans. They swept the Bronx Bombers for the first time in 15 years, and looked rather good doing it. The Mets averaged a 3.2 between two telecasts on RSN Sportsnet New York and over-the-air WPIX. That includes an SNY-season high 2.9 for Wednesday's Game 3 and a WPIX-season high 3.8 for Game 4 on Thursday. The Mets 3.2 average actually beat out the 3.1 average for the Yankees, who televised three of the games on YES and Wednesday's game on local OTA WWOR.
Chicago: Usually the crosstown series are the biggest story in whatever city they're happening, but the Cubs-White Sox series happened to take place during the Blackhawks playoff run, which went up against Monday's Game 1 and likely ate in to some of the numbers, and likely kept the series in the back of some people's minds. Also, both teams are middling-to-poor this season. The two teams also swapped between CSN Chicago and over-the-air WGN during the week. The Cubs, who swept the three-game series (Tuesday's game was postponed), outdrew the White Sox, 2.2 to 2.1. Monday's Game 1 drew a 4.5 on WGN for the Sox broadcast, their highest over-the-air rating since June of 2011.
Southern California: With both teams at a fairly equal level this season (disappointing), the Dodgers probably have an unfair advantage here. They have Vin Scully, and they also broadcast three of the games in this series on over-the-air KCAL 9, as opposed to the Angels, who do not have Vin Scully and broadcast all four games on FS West. The Dodgers won the battle, 2.9 to 1.9. The Angels, who split the series, reached season highs twice on FSW.
Bay Area: Not really a fair fight. Even though the upstart Athletics are impressive, the Giants have all of the buzz and stars of a team that has won the World Series two of the last three seasons. They dominated the week, ratings-wise, despite getting beat three out of four. The four games -- three on CSN Bay Area, one on NBC affiliate KNTV -- averaged a 5.3 in the market. The A's -- who televised all four games on CSN California -- averaged a 1.6 rating. Wednesday's game, however, drew a season high 3.1 for Oakland.</div></a><a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Blade-Runner-Sequel-Coming-From-Green-Lantern-Screenwriter-37840.html" data-url="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Blade-Runner-Sequel-Coming-From-Green-Lantern-Screenwriter-37840.html" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="7a592670e00cfb92779ec480a17e09ccfce1b3f6" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="263"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/7a592670e00cfb92779ec480a17e09ccfce1b3f6"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - cinemablend.com</h2><h1>Blade Runner Sequel Coming From Green Lantern Screenwriter</h1>Someone give him the Voight-Kampff test.</div></a><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22735883#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa" data-url="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22735883#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="08fbfd4f69fc11cb2cdaeacbeac39fcaf05d55f7" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="264"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/08fbfd4f69fc11cb2cdaeacbeac39fcaf05d55f7"></figure><div><h2>News - bbc.co.uk</h2><h1>Man charged over soldier stabbing</h1>Judges in France charge a man with "attempted murder linked to a terrorist enterprise" after a soldier was stabbed in a district near Paris.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650678/s/2cafcc85/l/0Ljezebel0N0Cmeet0Ethe0Ewoman0Ebehind0Eprancercise0Ethe0Egreatest0Efitness0E510A736826/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650678/s/2cafcc85/l/0Ljezebel0N0Cmeet0Ethe0Ewoman0Ebehind0Eprancercise0Ethe0Egreatest0Efitness0E510A736826/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:628px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="481467a606783640cd7703b6dc24c1501b2d1b4e" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="266"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/xl/hq/481467a606783640cd7703b6dc24c1501b2d1b4e"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - jezebel.com</h2><h1>Meet the Woman Behind Prancercise, the Greatest Fitness Sensation Ever</h1>Remember Joanna Rohrback? The Woman Who Prances While the World Dances? She is having her day in the sun and prancing too!
Rohrback did an interview with The Daily Beast ‚Äì amazing how she found time, seeing as "she can barely keep track of the interview requests galloping in" GET IT? ‚Äì where she explained the genesis of this dance craze that could have swept the nation, had the Internet existed like it does now. The year was 1989 (cue mystical music or Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative"):

"'I must have heard a really good song I liked on the radio,' Rohrback said. 'I started moving in a rhythmic way, using ankle weights. And it just evolved.'

It felt like prancing, she said, like the way a happy horse frolics through a field of poppies. She was using her upper body and her legs, and because the whole thing was so fluid and natural, there was no pounding impact on the pavement. Prancercise was born, and it was beautiful."

Rohrback believes that had she found investors, Prancercise would have been like Zumba. You know Zumba, that super-fun, not at all frightening work-out craze with a terrible name, featured in even worse commercials. Remember today as the day we learned that America missed out on the Original Zumba. You can try to relive what could have been at Rohrback's website.

NFL.com brings its own special brand of the Spelling Bee to the San Francisco 49ers' locker room as several players were asked to complete the simple task of spelling their teammate's name.&nbsp;
OK, it may not be that simple, because the teammate happens to be Nna...Nu...Nom...Nnamdi Asomugha. Phew.&nbsp;
As you can see, a good amount of players try to maneuver the perilous road of spelling their new star's name, only to careen off the side into the abyss of failure.&nbsp;
The 49ers welcomed the star corner to the team in April with a one-year deal that could be worth about $3 million, according to ESPN.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, nobody on the team bothered to learn how to spell his name. And to think, Asomugha would have never known if not for the video made topical by Thursday's Scripps&nbsp;National Spelling Bee, won by a young speller who is apparently&nbsp;unaffected by winning tournaments.
&nbsp;
I really do appreciate each San Francisco player who went with classic spelling bee tactics, but the video really could have used the&nbsp;addition&nbsp;of the elimination bell. I am also grateful that one player, Colin Kaepernick, finally completed the task.
As for Kaepernick, the QB shows way more emotion than young&nbsp;Arvind Mahankali who won the actual Bee.&nbsp;
Now I think Jim Harbaugh should think long and hard about instituting something that might&nbsp;breed camaraderie and familiarity. Yes, the 49ers really need to invest in some name tags. Although, Asomugha should probably fill out his own.&nbsp;

The Los Angeles Dodgers need something, anything, to turn around a 2013 season that is slowly getting away from them.
The time is right to bring in the organization‚Äôs top prospect. It just might happen too, as the Dodgers are considering making the move, according to CBS Sports‚Äô MLB insider Jon Heyman:
Puig (pronounced Pweeg) is indeed said by sources connected to the Dodgers to be "under consideration'' for a call-up after initial word from manager Don Mattingly initially was interpreted by the media to mean that they were going to pass this time on both their top outfield prospects, Puig and Joc Pederson. And Puig was switched to center field for Thursday in what looks like a clear signal just how seriously the Dodgers are considering his callup.
Puig has been playing phenomenal baseball in the minors, garnering the attention of both local and national media. He received increased attention after exploding on Thursday night while playing center field.
ESPN SiruisXM co-host Jim Bowden pondered whether or not his move to center and remarkable stat-line are an indicator of a pending move (via Twitter):

No call-up has ensued following his 3-for-4, one-RBI, two stolen bases and two-run performance during that Thursday night ballgame.
However, it wouldn‚Äôt be shocking to see something happen in the near future.
Bernie Pleskoff, a MLB.com writer and scout, said Puig has a similar physique and abilities to former standout player Bo Jackson.
Specifically, Pleskoff highlighted his aggression at the plate, ‚Äúgood eye-hand coordination‚Äù and fast hands which allow him to drive the ball to anywhere on the field.

His physique is what has people buzzing the most and drawing Jackson comparisons.
Puig stands at 6‚Äô3‚Äù and weighs 245 lbs. Despite his large size, the 22-year-old prospect doesn‚Äôt lose any athletic edge. In fact, his physical attributes are off the charts. Stealing bases and covering ground in the outfield won‚Äôt be a problem at the next level‚Äîat least from a physical standpoint.
Pleskoff, who scouted Puig in the minors, said there are some things he still needs to work on:
Improved plate discipline and pitch recognition are among the components of Puig's offense that need more seasoning‚Ä¶ Defensively‚Ä¶ He has to continue to work on recognizing the flight of the ball off the bat more quickly. Puig also has to continue to gain accuracy on his throws. His basic skills project Puig to be an average outfielder.&nbsp;
Whatever ends up happening in the near future, Puig looks to have the measurables and ability to develop into a major star. The Dodgers shouldn‚Äôt rush things to help fix an immediate need, but there is no denying the predicament they are currently in.

It‚Äôs also hard to imagine the youngster not having a positive effect for the limping Dodgers. Matt Kemp is on the 15-day disabled list and the team desperately needs someone to fill the void until he gets back.
This is, without a doubt, the best time to test Puig‚Äôs progress and give him a sizeable amount of major league action. Los Angeles is fading; they have to do something to help energize their dugout in order to avoid falling further behind the talented NL West.
Puig's plate aggression and base-running ability could help lead a late-first-half resurgence that would propel the Dodgers back into contention before the All-Star break. There is plenty of time to get things back on track. Making this move at this point in time is the best option for Don Mattingly.
It‚Äôs a win-win; a move the Dodgers have to pull the trigger on.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://www.zimbio.com/Super+Catchy+Tunes/articles/vSUa2XbE37I/Glee+Star+Matthew+Morrison+Shows+Off+Swing" data-url="http://www.zimbio.com/Super+Catchy+Tunes/articles/vSUa2XbE37I/Glee+Star+Matthew+Morrison+Shows+Off+Swing" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="3882364f6ef427e52bcc326a82fbf5a7c28827c8" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="275"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/3882364f6ef427e52bcc326a82fbf5a7c28827c8"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - zimbio.com</h2><h1>'Glee' Star Matthew Morrison Shows Off His Swing Moves in His 'It Don't Mean a Thing' Music Video</h1>Morrison returns to his Broadway roots in his retro new vid.</div></a><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1658187-ohio-state-president-gordon-gee-reportedly-told-by-trustees-may-lead-to-removal" data-url="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1658187-ohio-state-president-gordon-gee-reportedly-told-by-trustees-may-lead-to-removal" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="2b17c9c252fa16a5cde5113e4fa85b6cbe4beb23" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="276"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/2b17c9c252fa16a5cde5113e4fa85b6cbe4beb23"></figure><div><h2>Sports - bleacherreport.com</h2><h1>Ohio State President Gordon Gee Reportedly Told More Mistakes May Prompt Removal</h1>Ohio State University president Gordon Gee's loose lips and free spending have made him a lightning rod of controversy throughout his tenure at the school, frustrating alumni and alienating entire sects of the country.
The university's board of trustees has reportedly made it clear that it won't tolerate Gee's oratory malfeasance going forward.&nbsp;
According to a report from Collin Binkley of The Columbus Dispatch,&nbsp;university trustees sent a letter signed by board chairman&nbsp;Robert H. Schottenstein and trustee Alex Shumate&nbsp;on behalf of the entire board on March 11, threatening to remove Gee from his post with one more slip-up.
While lauding Gee, who is in his second term at Ohio State, for his work elsewhere, the letter made it clear his propensity for putting his foot in his mouth adversely affects the university.
‚ÄúHowever, on occasion your words that may be intended to bring a bit of levity to some significant issue have, in fact, had the opposite effect,‚Äù the letter says.

Gee has come under fire recently after disparaging comments the Ohio State president made when meeting with the school's athletics council in December. According to an Associated Press report, Gee, who is Mormon, openly disparaged Catholics as untrustworthy.
"The fathers are holy on Sunday, and they're holy hell on the rest of the week," Gee said. "You just can't trust those damn Catholics on a Thursday or a Friday, and so, literally, I can say that."

Gee continued, sending a fusillade of insults toward Notre Dame. He noted that the university was never invited to the Big Ten Conference because priests are "not good partners." Gee also derided the academic integrity of Louisville University and the entire SEC.
Gee later apologized for his comments and claimed to be joking at the time.&nbsp;
"The comments I made were just plain wrong, and in no way do they reflect what the university stands for," Gee said. "They were a poor attempt at humor and entirely inappropriate."
Had this been a one-time incident, the 69-year-old likely would have gotten away with a slap on the wrist. But Gee also had to apologize in 2012 after saying the coordination of the university's subdivisions was like a "Polish army."
Gee is currently undergoing a "remediation plan," as requested by the board of trustees.</div></a><a href="http://feeds.abcnews.com/c/35229/f/654832/s/2caf3b00/l/0Labcnews0Bgo0N0Cblogs0Cheadlines0C20A130C0A50Czac0Ehanson0Eto0Ewelcome0Ethird0Echild0Einto0Efold0C/story01.htm" data-url="http://feeds.abcnews.com/c/35229/f/654832/s/2caf3b00/l/0Labcnews0Bgo0N0Cblogs0Cheadlines0C20A130C0A50Czac0Ehanson0Eto0Ewelcome0Ethird0Echild0Einto0Efold0C/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="d1ba6cf96ac498177f45721d2121737527d468fb" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="277"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/d1ba6cf96ac498177f45721d2121737527d468fb"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - abcnews.com</h2><h1>Hanson Brother to Welcome 3rd Baby</h1>Zac Hanson‚Äôs new album will be quickly followed by a new addition to his family.

And those who felt that way were vindicated after the referee blew his whistle for full time in this match.&nbsp;
Italy scored two goals on each side of the half to cruise to a 4-0 win over San Marino, giving the Azzurri nothing to complain about from&nbsp;Stadio Renato Dall'Ara on Friday evening.&nbsp;
Football Italia had the tweet as Italy took home the commanding victory and now prepares to make personnel choices with respect to the lineup in crucial matches:

As the Azzurri's official Twitter account posted well before the actual match was played on Friday, the last time these two squads met in a friendly was 1992. The result was the same then as it was in 2013, as the Italians dominated the ball and the net in the 4-0 result:

Overall, the Italians thoroughly dominated the pace, the possession and nearly all aspects of the game. The Azzurri keepers didn't have to do much to keep possession in their favor, and the few times San Marino did mount an attack, the threat was quickly&nbsp;thwarted.&nbsp;
Andrea Poli opened up the scoring for Italy in the 28th minute, per 101GreatGoals:

That goal would be followed by one from Alberto Gilardino, who scored just six minutes later to give the Italians a 2-0 lead. That lead would hold up until halftime, and the pace of play was just too much for San Marino to gather in the first half.&nbsp;
The only reason the score wasn't even more in Italy's favor was due to keeper&nbsp;Aldo Simoncini, who had several nice stops in the first half to keep the San Marino side somewhat in the game.&nbsp;

After he was taken off prior to the start of the next half, you got the sense that San Marino was just readying their players on the bench with more experience against a squad in Italy that could have won this match by 10.&nbsp;
One of the surprise substitutes in the second half was former Manchester City star and A.C. Milan striker Mario Balotelli. He was not expected to play after injuries had kept him limited so far, but&nbsp;Cesare Prandelli decided he needed some action against the struggling San Marino side.&nbsp;
The Azzurri Twitter had the post as he warmed up to enter the game:

He would enter the game in the 51st minute, and it was clear the San Marino side could not keep up with his pace throughout the rest of the second half. He had several runs that could have resulted in goals, and he helped open up the field for his teammates to find creases to lengthen the score.&nbsp;
One such score was this free-kick boot from Andrea Pirlo to give the Italians a 3-0 lead, via 101GreatGoals:&nbsp;

The Azzurri would find the net one more time in the 80th minute, when Pirlo's free kick bounced off reserve goalkeeper Federico Valentini and was knocked in off the&nbsp;ricochet&nbsp;by&nbsp;Alberto Aquilani, who had several good chances to score all day and finally found the net in the final few minutes.&nbsp;
The result was a 4-0 win for an Italy side that expects to compete with FIFA's top teams in the 2014 World Cup.&nbsp;

What's Next.

Italy has a huge match coming up in the next few days, as they will travel to face the Czech Republic in World Cup Qualifying play on June 7. A friendly with Haiti awaits after that, but then the next seven matches will not have the kind of ease or free spirit that the friendly competition allows.&nbsp;
The Italians have three Confederations Cup matches in late June and won't be together again for World Cup Qualifying until September, when four matches could decide their 2014 WC fate.&nbsp;
San Marino doesn't currently have any matches looming in the near future, but they will try to regroup for qualifying this fall and see if they can pull off the myriad of upsets it will take to make it to the big time.&nbsp;

Hjalmar is a chef; Alex takes woodworking courses. Today, they write about the riots that swept Stockholm and other Swedish towns last week. We have lightly edited their post for grammar and punctuation.
This article might anger a lot of people, but I don‚Äôt really care, because most of the time, the truth sucks.
Last week riots have sparked in Sweden, started by a fatal shooting of a 69-year-old Portuguese immigrant in the suburbs of Stockholm. Police states the man was wielding a machete in the middle of the street. I have no further information about the machete man, but the devastation that has followed speaks in volume, something has gone horrible wrong.

But this didn‚Äôt start last week, it started a long time ago, when the Swedish government accepted a large number of immigrants coming from war-torn countries without having a proper infrastructure to deal with a promise they made to give a human being a second chance on a normal life. To take people in need and help them get back on their feet, welcoming them with open arms, teaching them the language and embracing their culture while they take in the local one.
But riots like this is nothing new, it happened in: France, Italy, Germany, USA. And now I am just talking about large-scale‚Äîprotest and hunger strikes are daily thinks for immigration offices around the world.
There is nothing wrong with helping people, but there is something seriously wrong when the government put a large number of people into the same area, same large group housing, don‚Äôt provide jobs or proper education, parents go unemployed, children watch their parents rot from the inside while they themself don't have the help to catch up to the native kids in school, they group together with other immigrant kids.
Group that understands each other, they become adults, raised with out hope, as outcasts, having kids of their own in the mini-country they have formed inside their host country, a ghetto. This is not the truth for everyone, but the people I gotten to know in the last three years, most of them have immigrated or their parents, they all tell the same story‚Äîbad schools, secluded, and hard time ‚Äúfitting in.‚Äù
I am a immigrant, but a very lame one, I moved here from Iceland, so I am Nordic, I have white parents, come from a white family and thus I am white. I am used to the Scandic language and share a lot of the same culture. I hate admitting it, but being white is privilege in many countries, just one of those warning lights that should tell us that there is something seriously wrong with humankind, but we don‚Äôt care, we don‚Äôt really care any further then we can toss our wallets beyond that point our reality ends.
But when I moved here, I got the chance of studying in the immigration system or SFI (Swedish for Immigrants). The courses were free, we were handed photocopied study material for 8-10 year old, and told to discuss it between each other, totally unorganized. We did have a teacher, though she was more of an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù than ‚Äúteacher." I had to go to the unemployment office to sign up as unemployed, I am sure the ratio was 1/10 Swedish, rest was immigrants, and a lot of them just trying to get jobs in the field they educated themselves in; doctors, computer technicians, engineers, lawyers. Only to end up with minimum paid jobs for the uneducated.
This riots have been boiling up for a long time, not the first one in Sweden and not the last one, if the government is gone help refugees and take in immigrants they need to be able to do so.

I hope I didn‚Äôt come off as a nationalist, I don‚Äôt consider my self off any nation but of this planet, but I guess I am just fucked in the head, wanting equality and rights for everyone, stupid me.

Haas shot a 67 on Friday, impressive considering he could've finished even stronger without a couple of bogeys on the back nine. Matt Kuchar, who followed his first round 68 with a 70 on Friday, is currently in second place at 6-under.

Trust Me.</h1>By now you know some racist dicks have whipped themselves up in a frenzy of racist dickery over the portrayal of an interracial family in a Cheerios ad. You see, Cheerios has committed the heinous crime of ‚Äúacknowledging that interracial families exist,‚Äù and also that ‚Äúsometimes interracial families need to eat breakfast.‚Äù This was too much for the racist dicks‚ÄîCheerios was forced to disable comments on YouTube where the video was posted. (What‚Äôs up with you racist dicks, anyway? Don‚Äôt you have jobs?)
I am biracial. My mom is black and my dad is white. My family often had the audacity to eat breakfast even though cereal was not being specifically marketed to us. When I was growing up, there were no families on television that resembled mine. My family was something of an anomaly in the overwhelmingly white neighborhood of Seattle where I lived. When I was with my mom, people would look at me and ask, ‚ÄúWhat is she?‚Äù When I was with my dad, people would ask, ‚ÄúIs she Italian?‚Äù Because this is definitely the kind of information that strangers are entitled to.
But life was even more confusing for my brother. He was born with blond, curly hair and bright blue eyes. He looked nothing like my mom. When they were alone together, well, that‚Äôs when shit got real. The white mothers in my neighborhood not only assumed my mom was my brother‚Äôs nanny, but they inquired after her services. Single brows were raised when my mom assured these awful women that she was, in fact, the biological mother of my brother. (This was before Botox. Eyebrows could move freely then.) When my maternal grandmother came to pick us up from daycare, despite being on the authorized pick-up list, they made sure to call my dad to make sure this black lady was legit. (By the way, there are worse things than being kidnapped by a black lady in a luxury Cadillac who takes you to her country club for lunch and lets you drive the golf cart.)
Yeah, okay, this was in 1991 or whatever and Halle Berry hadn‚Äôt won an Oscar yet so maybe racial dynamics were more confusing then. But just last week (IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN), a white father in Virginia was suspected by a Walmart security guard of kidnapping after he made the mistake of being seen in public with his own biracial children. A customer reported the father to the security guard after seeing him in the parking lot with his children and deeming the scene ‚Äústrange.‚Äù Local police were dispatched to the family‚Äôs home to investigate. The children were made to positively identify their own parents, in their own home. As dumb as this sounds, this Cheerios commercial at least provides idiots in the parking lot at Walmart a foundation of knowledge about interracial families. I don‚Äôt necessarily want strangers to look at me with my parents and think ‚ÄúCHEERIOS FAMILY,‚Äù but if the alternative is bailing my dad out jail, then I guess I‚Äôll take it.

This commercial is a huge step for interracial families like mine who want to be seen in public together and maybe eat some heart-healthy snacks. But it also validates the existence of biracial and multiracial people. Often we‚Äôre treated like exotic flowers, who should feel complimented when people say stuff to us like, ‚ÄúAll biracial women are so beautiful‚Äù or ‚ÄúI would kill for your skin.‚Äù One of the hardest things about growing up the way I did is feeling like you need to choose one racial identity over another just to fit in. The fact that strangers constantly ask you to identify yourself (forcing you to put yourself in a category) makes you feel conspicuous and gazed upon. You catch strangers looking at you. You know what they want to ask you. You know that they won‚Äôt leave you alone until you give them a rundown of your heritage.

So, this is just a stupid commercial about Cheerios but it means a lot to me. It shows interracial families and their children being normal and cute, not something to gawk at or to question. Hopefully this commercial will lead to even more positive representations of not just interracial families, but all kinds of non-traditional families. To Cheerios, I give you one internet high-five, for doing your part to normalize families like mine and people like me. Increased visibility of our differences leads to things like ‚Äúacceptance‚Äù and ‚Äúdisrupting the status quo‚Äù and also ‚Äúnot arresting biracial people‚Äôs dads for kidnapping.‚Äù Bravo. Now excuse me while I go dump a box of cereal on my dad.

However, their offense stalled in the second half, producing only 35 points‚Äîincluding just 13 in the third quarter‚Äîen route to a 90-79 loss.
Here are a few areas the Pacers must focus on to pull out a win in Game 6.
&nbsp;
Paul George Must Be Assertive.
With Danny Granger out for most of the season, George is the primary scoring option. In the first two games of the series, he averaged 24.5 points per contest and connected on 50 percent of his shot attempts.
However, George has not been nearly as effective at home. In Games 3 and 4, he was almost a non-factor, scoring a total of 25 points while shooting 35 percent from the field.
With the venue shifting back to Indianapolis, George will have to produce in a big way if the Pacers are going to extend the series to a seventh game.
&nbsp;
Additional Scoring Punch.
The good news is the Pacers' frontcourt trio of George, Roy Hibbert and David West combined for 66 points and shot an efficient 53 percent from the field in Game 5.
The bad news is the supporting cast was a no-show, scoring just 13 points and shooting a dismal 5-of-20 from the field.
In addition to that, the backcourt combination of George Hill and Lance Stephenson managed just five points and six turnovers.
That said, the Pacers will need other players to shoulder the scoring load if they want to avoid falling to the Heat in six games like they did a year ago.
&nbsp;
Limit Turnovers.
Turning the ball over at a high rate is never a positive. This especially holds true when you play against a Miami team that thrives off its opponents' miscues.
The Pacers committed 18 turnovers in Game 5, which led to 22 points for the Heat. During the postseason, the Pacers are now 1-6 in games when they have turned the ball over more than 17 times.
Simply put, if the Pacers continue to be careless with the basketball, their season is as good as over in Game 6.</div></a><a href="http://operanfca.feedsportal.com/c/35165/f/652306/s/2caf3870/l/0L0Ssportsnet0Bca0Chockey0Cnhl0Cjohnston0Eeakins0Eready0Eto0Emake0Ejump0Eto0Enhl0C/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfca.feedsportal.com/c/35165/f/652306/s/2caf3870/l/0L0Ssportsnet0Bca0Chockey0Cnhl0Cjohnston0Eeakins0Eready0Eto0Emake0Ejump0Eto0Enhl0C/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="350987e29ed0aa1c1ca2f909b7392822cfed310d" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="304"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/350987e29ed0aa1c1ca2f909b7392822cfed310d"></figure><div><h2>Sports - sportsnet.ca</h2><h1>Johnston: Eakins ready to make jump to NHL</h1>After years of success in the Maple Leafs organization, Toronto Marlies head coach Dallas Eakins has become a hot commodity and it‚Äôs only a matter of time before he makes the jump to the NHL.</div></a><a href="http://feeds.eonline.com/~r/eonline/topstories/~3/1YKJruh3DsU/watch-oprah-winfrey-deliver-inspirational-commencement-speech-at-harvard-university" data-url="http://feeds.eonline.com/~r/eonline/topstories/~3/1YKJruh3DsU/watch-oprah-winfrey-deliver-inspirational-commencement-speech-at-harvard-university" class="item" style="width:308px; height:148px; left: 646px; top: 326px;" data-id="d5b07a5998f628ca514aea6bdc84997ea382d66d" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="304"><div><h2>Entertainment - eonline.com</h2><h1>Watch Oprah Winfrey Deliver Inspirational Commencement Speech at Harvard University</h1>It there's anyone who can inspire graduates (or anyone, for that matter), it's Oprah Winfrey.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://www.japantoday.com/category/world/view/portugals-main-union-calls-general-strike-on-june-27" data-url="http://www.japantoday.com/category/world/view/portugals-main-union-calls-general-strike-on-june-27" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="811e5cbfe305e8c72379281d487bd180598fd88a" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="305"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/811e5cbfe305e8c72379281d487bd180598fd88a"></figure><div><h2>News - japantoday.com</h2><h1>World ‚Ä∫ Portugal's main union calls general strike on June 27</h1>Portugal's main trade union on Friday called for a general strike to protest austerity measures on June 27.</div></a><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1658117-italy-vs-san-marino-post-match-thoughts-and-comment" data-url="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1658117-italy-vs-san-marino-post-match-thoughts-and-comment" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="4215c6273c3e62f9ff217e006996fcd11f8933c6" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="306"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/4215c6273c3e62f9ff217e006996fcd11f8933c6"></figure><div><h2>Sports - bleacherreport.com</h2><h1>Italy vs. San Marino: Post Match Thoughts and Comment</h1>Cesare Prandelli's used this meaningless friendly as an experimentation session with the Italian national team to test out new players and tactics.
Minnows San Marino still haven't managed to score a goal in World Cup qualifying and sit last in their group with zero points. For geographical purposes, this was an easy friendly to set up, and it also gives the San Marino players a chance to go up against some of the hottest stars in world football.
Even though it's hard to truly gauge the performance of an Italian player in a match like this because the opposition is so poor, it's still a way to see how players work with each other chemistry-wise.
Since the actual match was a 4-0&nbsp;(Poli 28', Gilardino 34', Pirlo 50', Aquilani 79') blowout, let's focus on the new players for Italy and how they might fit in the future.&nbsp;

Right away, Prandelli went with Torino defender Angelo Ogbonna, who is usually a first-choice substitute if one of the three Juventus defenders go down with an injury.
Ogbonna still needs to make the jump to a quality team if he wants to take his game to the next level.
He's athletic&nbsp;and has wonderful anticipatory instincts. Expect him to be brought to the Confederations Cup as well as the World Cup next year as a substitute.&nbsp;
New inclusion Giacomo Bonaventura is one to watch out for. The highly versatile Atalanta midfielder can score goals and provide width and creativity.

While it'll be hard for him to win a place in a very deep Italian midfield, Bonaventura can carve his role as a utility substitute who can be used in various circumstances.
The last player we're going to focus on is Marco Sau.
The speedy Cagliari striker was a revelation in Serie A this season, scoring 12 goals for the Sardinian side. A diminutive player, he gives Italy a different look up front, where he can take on defenders with quick footwork and curl fantastic shots from outside the box.&nbsp;
He can play on either flank in a 4-3-3 or up front in a two-striker formation like he does alongside Victor Ibarbo at Cagliari.
Sau deserved his chance to shine in La Nazionale and was rewarded by Cesare Prandelli.
Overall, it was a great chance for Prandelli to use some of the fringe players in Serie A. Expect some of the players listed above to see their roles increased in the next few months.</div></a><a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/kanye-west-yeezus-album-cover-art" data-url="http://www.spin.com/articles/kanye-west-yeezus-album-cover-art" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="d99306b90db67688eba4e03730aa51e13e8ad4cd" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="307"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/d99306b90db67688eba4e03730aa51e13e8ad4cd"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - spin.com</h2><h1>Purported Kanye West 'Yeezus' Album Cover Is Way More Boring Than We'd Hoped</h1>So, it turns out that the cover of Kanye West's new album&nbsp;Yeezus&nbsp;may not be the melted gold piece of art that we thought it...</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:160px;"><a href="http://feeds.abcnews.com/c/35229/f/654825/s/2caf3113/l/0Labcnews0Bgo0N0CInternational0CwireStory0Cguards0Elibyan0Eoil0Efield0Eprotest0Eforce0Eshutdown0E1930A0A20A6/story01.htm" data-url="http://feeds.abcnews.com/c/35229/f/654825/s/2caf3113/l/0Labcnews0Bgo0N0CInternational0CwireStory0Cguards0Elibyan0Eoil0Efield0Eprotest0Eforce0Eshutdown0E1930A0A20A6/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:148px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="bd17fc2273006d35ac5fe3d84dce73d670c0787e" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="308"><div><h2>News - abcnews.com</h2><h1>Guards at Libyan Oil Field Protest, Force Shutdown</h1>Guards at southern Libyan oil field force shutdown in protest over back pay.</div></a><a href="http://feeds.eonline.com/~r/eonline/topstories/~3/wtY3IMR3sw4/anna-nicole-smith-s-daughter-dannielynn-may-inherit-49-million" data-url="http://feeds.eonline.com/~r/eonline/topstories/~3/wtY3IMR3sw4/anna-nicole-smith-s-daughter-dannielynn-may-inherit-49-million" class="item" style="width:308px; height:148px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="13d7d95d769dd30d777dce86dd35a60604d0e98d" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="309"><div><h2>Entertainment - eonline.com</h2><h1>Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter, Dannielynn, May Inherit $49 Million</h1>A decision has been reached.</div></a><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/05/31/microsoft-quietly-gains-share-in-virtualization/?mod=WSJBlog" data-url="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2013/05/31/microsoft-quietly-gains-share-in-virtualization/?mod=WSJBlog" class="item" style="width:308px; height:148px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="48fbf33608fa18f35099a74b237689728a688878" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="310"><div><h2>Technology - blogs.wsj.com</h2><h1>Microsoft Quietly Gains Share in Virtualization</h1>While Microsoft is struggling to gain share in markets for mobile phones and tablets, the company has quietly become a fast-growing provider of virtualization software.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650679/s/2cafc83e/l/0Lgawker0N0Csmartphone0Eapp0Eclaims0Eit0Ecan0Ecure0Ehomosexuality0Ein0E60A0E510A738648/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650679/s/2cafc83e/l/0Lgawker0N0Csmartphone0Eapp0Eclaims0Eit0Ecan0Ecure0Ehomosexuality0Ein0E60A0E510A738648/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:628px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="5e0ef2c6c904e48915f5f34a449b7514406ed2cc" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="312"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/xl/hq/5e0ef2c6c904e48915f5f34a449b7514406ed2cc"></figure><div><h2>Entertainment - gawker.com</h2><h1>Smartphone App Claims It Can 'Cure' Homosexuality in 60 Days or Less</h1>Setting Captives Free, a "non-denominational" Christian ministry named after a verse from the Old Testament, peddles in self-help courses it claims can cure you of all that ails you: Drinking, smoking, pornography. Even homosexuality.
The interactive 60-day course called "Door of Hope" purports to teach users how "to enjoy a newfound relationship with the Lord and how to find freedom from homosexuality."
A mobile version of Door of Hope was recently made available for iPhone through the iTunes App Store and for Android phones through the Google Play Store.
"[D]espite what you may have heard elsewhere, you do not have a ‚Äòhomosexual gene,‚Äô nor were you born this way with no hope of freedom," reads the app's description, penned by Setting Captives Free founder and president Mike Cleveland.
A Queerty reader who was exposed to the Door of Hope conversion course as a teen had this to say about the "lessons" contained therein:

They might have changed the structure of the class since I was enrolled (I am now 23 and in college) but at the time I took it there were lessons that said homosexuality was caused by demons, that there was a subculture that exists in the gay community that is a cult that worships male genitalia (I really wish I was making this up. I‚Äôm not.), and had graphic descriptions of how anal sex allegedly causes men to lose the ability to hold in feces.
The gist of it is that the course was very traumatic for me and I actually attempted suicide while taking it. The class was interactive and I was assigned a mentor that I communicated with on the phone so it had the effect of being more than something I was just passively reading. He made me report to him every time I masturbated, and if I did masturbate then that was used as blame for my lack of ‚Äúrecovery‚Äù and I was encouraged to punish myself by cutting off television, video games, etc. and also wearing a rubber band around my wrist to snap when I had a "homosexual thought."

Happily, the app was pulled from the iTunes store today following a successful awareness campaign by AllOut.
Unfortunately, it is still available for download through the Google Play store, through Google says it is "investigating the complaints made about the app."
Sadly, deleting one nefarious app won't do much to put a dent in the anti-gay movement writ large.

When the first AOC opened a decade ago, nobody quite knew what to make of the place, a wine bar near the original Farmers Market that seemed to specialize in cured meats, salads and lots of tiny dishes that reflected the flavors of coastal Italy and Provence, but also Spain and North Africa. We were younger then, and as much as we respected chef Suzanne Goin, who was moonlighting from her restaurant Lucques, neither harissa nor the herby marinade

Today we've got reports from Wired:Autopia, Petrolicious, GreenCarReports and Yahoo! Autos. Mission Motorcycles Hopes You‚Äôll Pay $60K for a Tesla on Two Wheels ‚Äì Autopia
Electric bikes continue to improve and offer a certain few advantages over larger EVs, but range is still an issue. Now one group is promising 200 miles (max) range with a realistic 10 miles. Not bad. More impressive is the lithium-ion battery, which packs 17 kWh of juice ‚Äî one kWh more than the miserable four-wheeled Mitsubishi i-MiEV ‚Äî along with a pair of on-board chargers that allow nine kW worth of energy transfer during charging. All told, Mission estimates a max range of 200 miles, but on the combined city/highway cycle, riders will get 140 miles in the real world, and be able to top up that massive battery pack in around two hours through the industry standard J1772 Level 2 charging stations. According to Seeger, ‚ÄúEven a short rest stop is enough time to add a significant amount of range.‚Äù At the Monaco Grand Prix, where James Bond spends a weekend at Bernie‚Äôs ‚Äì Yahoo! Autos

The great Neal Pollack takes on Monaco. We've got some posts coming from Bill Caswell as well. Speaking of ‚Äúpaying for sex,‚Äù it‚Äôs impossible to describe the Monaco Grand Prix without talking about the Red Bull Energy Station, which has become the thumping hub of rich-person favor for the world‚Äôs most glamorous sporting weekend. The Energy Station, two stories of white steel and glass, makes an appearance at every European F1 event. But for Monaco, Red Bull adds a ‚Äúterrace,‚Äù with an outdoor bar and comfortable white couches arranged around a pallet of fake grass, and, more impressively, an upstairs outdoor pool deck, with water that they keep crystal clear so you can see the Red Bull logo at the bottom. These components are assembled in Italy and then floated 40 miles down the coast, where they get parked in Monaco Harbor‚Äôs prime docking spot, within view of several sections of the track. An invitation to the Energy Station means that you‚Äôre the boss, or at least someone the boss deems worthy. Does The Tesla Model S Electric Car Pollute More Than An SUV? ‚Äì GreenCarReports

There's an ongoing debate over just how clean EVs are and it's highly dependent on geography. We've arrived at a number for the real-world effective CO2 emissions of a Model S of 292 g/mi. Admittedly, that's lot higher than Tesla claims on its website. But worse than a Grand Cherokee? Hardly. The V-6 Grand Cherokee's official EPA CO2 number is 479 g/mi when fitted with the smallest engine offered, a 3.6-liter V-6. The more powerful V-8 model logs in at a whopping 592 g/mi. ZAGATO DESIGN BLENDS THE DIVINE AND THE ABSURD ‚Äì Petrolicious

Couldn't have said it better myself. The book of famous Italian coachbuilders brims with names synonymous with beautiful cars, among them the houses of Frua, Ghia, Touring, Vignale, Scaglietti, Bertone, and of course, Pininfarina. Though generally remembered for their most gorgeous contributions to automotive design, each is also responsible for a fair share of more polarizing work as well, Bertone‚Äôs Volvo 262C and Pininfarina‚Äôs Mondial merely a few that readily spring to mind. None, however, come close to matching Carrozzeria Zagato‚Äôs record for controversy. Perhaps Italy‚Äôs most adventurous, and therefore most vulnerable to fail auto design studio, Zagato‚Äôs bold, envelope-pushing approach has resulted in stunning, breakthrough concepts and shockingly grotesque failures in equal measure.</div></a><a href="http://feeds.latimes.com/~r/latimes/features/food/~3/LfpnSKhqcLo/la-fo-0601-virbila-20130601,0,6725943.story" data-url="http://feeds.latimes.com/~r/latimes/features/food/~3/LfpnSKhqcLo/la-fo-0601-virbila-20130601,0,6725943.story" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="7363891bd21d30a9143807ff5ebc719eb7bdb384" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="328"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/7363891bd21d30a9143807ff5ebc719eb7bdb384"></figure><div><h2>Food - latimes.com</h2><h1>How to make sense of the wine list</h1>Those wine lists at restaurants can be confusing.

What about childhood fantasies of being a race car driver? Interior designer? Well, whatever your secret dreams may be (well, assuming they're one of the above), this week's slew of Android apps want to make them become a reality‚Äîa virtual one, but a reality nonetheless. Sort of.

Jamstar: Learn-to-play-guitar apps are a dime a dozen, and to be honest, most of them aren't worth the data they take to download. Light up fretboards are great‚Äîuntil you try to move over to a real, non-illuminated guitar. JamStar, though, works more like a real live, actual guitar teacher would to help you get better on a real live, actual guitar. [Free]

Real Racing 3: Download at your own risk. Incredibly fun and dangerously addictive, Real Racing 3 is the newest installment of the popular Real Racing series. You'll be driving in Dubai with new cars, new tracks, and 50+ new events for you to get sucked into. Plus, it's free. You've got nothing to lose‚Äîyou know, other than all sense of productivity and purpose. [Free]

Furnish: Known once upon a time as IKEA Now, the now-revamped virtual remodeling app changed its name after running into a bit of legal trouble. But they're back and better than ever, bringing Android support and the addition of more than just IKEA furniture. So you can refurnish every room in your home as often as you want without spending a dime.

9.48 seconds: the limit to how fast a natural human could possibly run the 100-meter race, according to a Stanford biologist. That's 0.10 seconds faster than Usain Bolt's current world record.

8 percent: the portion of humans that still have the bendy, chimp-like feet of our tree-dwelling ancestors (yes, 1 in 13 people!)

1,100 degrees Fahrenheit: the heat produced by the Beam Down Tower in Masdar City, a fascinating experiment in concentrated solar power.

$1 million: the money asteroid mining company Planetary Resources hopes to raise on Kickstarter to build an orbiting space telescope that ordinary people can control from Earth.

100 feet: the firing range of Nerf's newest gun, which shoots MEGA darts nearly 55 mph.
27 hours: the time this Australian police department spent making a 3-D printed pistol. The plastic gun exploded.

1953: the year a botched lobotomy left Henry Molaison unable to form new memories. His personal tragedy would eventually revolutionize neuroscience.

71 percent: the accuracy with which this beer-pouring robot can predict the future, three seconds in advance.
$979: the price of the first office chair engineered to support the slouched backs and roving elbows of smartphone and tablet users.

Musyc: A music app for people who eschew tradition, Musyc gets rid of the familiar staples of drumkits, sound machines, and any other that utilize a UI that mimics its real-life counterpart. Instead, lines and shapes create your sounds‚Äîbounce them, line 'em up, crash them into one another, whatever you do, you'll have fun finding all the little different ways of making a melody. You can even choose from pre-loaded sound banks and sure your final masterpiece over a variety of music-oriented social media. A nice little creative outlet for the musically-minded who want something new. [$2]

iHeart Locket: Long gone are the days when kids would keep their innermost thoughts and secrets hidden away in a diary. For the most part they're happy to share everything on Facebook and Twitter these days, and in the rare event they'd actually want to keep something secret, there's now an iPad app that protects their private thoughts with an electronic locket key... for $25. But fortunately, the app is still perfectly usable without the accompanying hardware‚Äîand won't cost you a dime. [Free]

MySpace, Friendster, LiveJournal... lots of people have tried to resurrect these sites, and it has rarely, if ever, worked."</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:320px;"><a href="http://operanfuk.feedsportal.com/c/35143/f/650535/s/2cb01689/l/0L0Sguardian0O0Cbusiness0C20A130Cmay0C310Ccrowd0Efunding0Ebusiness0Eentrepreneur0Einvestment/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfuk.feedsportal.com/c/35143/f/650535/s/2cb01689/l/0L0Sguardian0O0Cbusiness0C20A130Cmay0C310Ccrowd0Efunding0Ebusiness0Eentrepreneur0Einvestment/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:308px; left: 646px; top: 6px;" data-id="c3fc5e42f563ea835890944866420a8c98167500" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="340"><figure style="height: 160px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/c3fc5e42f563ea835890944866420a8c98167500"></figure><div><h2>Technology - guardian.co.uk</h2><h1>Crowd-funding powers dynamic business</h1>From gravity lights to cat cafes, investment sites such as Indiegogo help entrepreneurs' projects take off.
It could be the best thing since Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio ‚Äì a cheap light that draws free power from gravity and could end the use of dangerous kerosene fuelled lamps in Africa and India.
But when British designer Patrick Hunt went down the conventional route of bank or venture capital finance to get his invention kickstarted commercially, he hit the buffers. "We tried to get funding to make it happen, but it's slow and complex and it's unproven and nobody wants to take a risk," he said.
So he tried crowd-funding on a US website, Indiegogo, which had recently opened up in the UK. Within five days he had hit his target and raised ¬£36,200. So popular was his campaign at the end of last year to entice donations from the public, that within 40 days he had raised a colossal ¬£400,000.
The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks. The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of about 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground it will generate enough power for a half hour of light.
Hunt is tooling up for production in China and will test the market again by delivering 1,000 of the lights to Africa before the full mass production of what he hopes will be millions of units.
He is one of a new wave of entrepreneurs turning to the fast-growing crowdfunding industry for finance. Venture capitalist Jon Moulton has now thrown his weight behind the sector by backing InvestingZone, a site due to launch next week that will match wealthy individuals with start up entrepreneurs.
Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer "perks" for different levels of donation ‚Äì those helping fund Hunt's innovative light not only got to feel good about helping the less well off, but also got their own light.
For Danae Ringelmann, below, co-founder of Indiegogo, the "gravity light" is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowd-funding can be and how it can test an entrepreneur's idea. "It is the first time that finance has been fast, efficient and meritocratic, because it is not about 'how do I get access to the decision makers in that bank?' or 'who do I know in that venture capital outfit?' This is all about proving your worth to your customers and fans, getting them to validate your idea and fund it.
"Even ideas that aren't deemed worthy enough to get funding are worth testing, because you will have saved yourself a whole bunch of time finding out it wasn't a good idea and getting smarter faster," she says.
Ringelmann, who is based in the US, started her career as a Wall Street analyst. In 2008, she decided to quit and use her skills to try and help friends who worked in the arts to raise money.
The site, started with co-founders Eric Schell and Slava Rubin, was originally focused on the film business and launched at the Sundance film festival that year.
Five years on and it is raising about $2m (¬£1.3m) a week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. Last December, it launched a euro and a sterling service to get a foothold this side of the Atlantic and says Britain is its third biggest market. International activity is up 41% since last December.
There is no shortage of competitors, be it Kickstarter, Seedrs and Funding Circle, but unlike rivals, says Ringelmann, Indiegogo is the only crowd-funder where anyone can launch a campaign. No project is deemed too whacky.
The site levies a 4% fee for successful campaigns. For those that fail to raise their target amount, users have the option of either refunding all money to their contributors at no charge or keeping all money raised but with a 9% fee.
As if to prove the point a British woman, Lauren Pears, raised ¬£100,000 to open a "cat cafe" in London's Shoreditch area through the site. Known as Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, it is yet to open but is billed as somewhere people can "come in from the cold to a comfortable wingback chair, a hot cup of tea, a book, and a cat".
"We've seen campaigns that go to venture capitalists, get rejected because the venture guys say 'great idea' but no idea if the market actually wants it; it could be a gadget that no one cares about," said Ringelmann.
"They get back, do an Indiegogo campaign, they don't even actually launch but the campaign itself is enough market proof for VCs to say there is a market for this.
"It allows you to test your market, test your pricing, test your features, discover new revenue streams, get vital feedback," says Ringelmann.
With her Wall Street background and the experience of helping 100,000 businesses and services raise finance, Ringelmann has fine-tuned her advice for the budding entrepreneur.
"Ideas are a dime a dozen. It's all about the execution and if someone is afraid that their idea would be nicked by someone who could execute it better and faster than you, then you are not the right person to do that idea. It's all about confidence to move fast and to learn," she says.
For Ringelmann the expansion into Europe and a deal with a web transaction provider which will allow payments to be made through local card services like Maestro in the UK or Carte Bleu in&nbsp;France as well as PayPal is part of a dream to democratise finance. More than 7,000 campaigns for finance are live on the site, from the heart-rending bid by a couple to fund the funeral of a 22-month-old child to a Londoner, Greg Dash, who is looking for ¬£35,000 to advance a thumb-sized fish-eye lens digital camera he has developed.
While crowd-funding as an alternative to banks has grown as high street lending has collapsed, it has limited appeal to big bucks investors who don't settle for anything less than a stake in a promising business. That could start to change in the UK with the launch of InvestingZone, while in the US Barack Obama is changing the law to allow crowd-funding for equity.
The JOBS act, when finally implemented, will make it easier for small companies to raise capital by trading equity for investments of up to $1m.
David Drake, founder of a New York private equity firm, LDJ Capital, maintains that the industry will be worth ¬£4bn in 2013.

So relive the glory days of the long weekend of yore, and kick back with a bundle of apps that aim to make your life just a little bit easier. Or at the very least, a little more fun.

Postcards: The Tumblr app is, admittedly, a wonderfully designed one. And there's no denying it has more functionality than something like Postcards. But for those who use Tumblr more as a means of finding articles to read instead zipping through streams of GIFs, this might be exactly what you're looking for. [$2]

Analog: A little over a year ago, Realmac Software released Clear, an iOS to-do list app that made the task of keeping track of tasks easy with a beautifully simple design. Now they're taking a crack at replicating that success by simplicity formula with a $1 camera app. For the most part, Analog Camera for iOS delivers what you'd expect: an unbelievably fast and straightforward app for snapping photos, adding gauzy filters, and uploading the shots to the Internet. You can see the filters and sharing in the screenshots above. There's nothing surprising about this functionality at all. [$1]

Furnish: Known once upon a time as IKEA Now, the now-revamped virtual remodeling app changed its name after running into a bit of legal trouble. But they're back and better than ever, bringing Android support and the addition of more than just IKEA furniture. So you can refurnish every room in your home as often as you want without spending a dime. [Free]

Tall Tall Chess: When you're in the market for a plain ol' chess app, there's really only so many variations until they all start looking the same. Tall Chess, at least, embraces this simplicity with bright colors, clean lines, and a bird's eye's view of the entire board. You can, as is now expected in nearly every mobile game, play against both friends and strangers. And it's free‚Äîas long as you only want to play one game at a time, that is.

If Russia carries through with its weapons deals ‚Äî S300 surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) ‚Äî there will be more Russian personnel on the ground to man those missile systems.
Moscow&nbsp;denies they have military in Syria and Israel is hinting that&nbsp;they'll strike any S300 system moving around Syria.
That Israel can destroy the missiles is of little consequence as Russia can just build more. It's the potential for Russian casualties caused by Israel air strikes that could expand the conflict. There's no replacement for lost life.
Russia's intentions with sending the hardware of S300 missile systems is only part of their strategy to stifle the U.S. precedent of regime change. Having Russians man&nbsp;the systems with personnel on the ground is a deterrent to Israeli air strikes. Loss of life is more politically significant&nbsp;than destroyed hardware, and Putin is aware of this.&nbsp;
Israel, the U.K., U.S., and France are much less likely to bomb systems manned by Russians. Especially considering Russia is a country that holds a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council.&nbsp;
Russia could be taking a page from 1962 Cuban missile crisis playbook, when the U.S. Air Force came up with a plan to run 100 bombing sorties to destroy Russian missile emplacements.
There were two problems to the Air Force plan back in 1962. One was the political implications of a U.S. strike on a smaller country. George Ball, then-undersecretary of state, said that a surprise attack of that magnitude would look like a "Pearl Harbor" in reverse.
The second problem was that &nbsp;a slew of Russian citizens would have been killed in the strikes ‚Äî which meant the move would have essentially put American and Russian forces in direct "hot war" contact.&nbsp;
Then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNammara said of the proposed bombing runs,&nbsp;"I don't know quite what kind of a world we live in after we've struck Cuba, and we've started it ... How do we stop at that point?"
Kennedy knew this. He'd already lost a U2 pilot to Russian SAMs and he didn't want to risk more gunfire.
Instead of more shots fired, Kennedy went the alternate route of blockading Cuba.&nbsp;The blockade put Russia and the U.S. navies "eyeball to eyeball," said then-Secretary of State&nbsp;Dean Rusk.
Russia blinked.
Today, Russia expects Israel and the U.S. to blink if they get the S300 weapon systems into Syria with several Russian operators.
The Obama administration has&nbsp;issued warnings to Putin about putting weapon systems on Syrian soil.
Those warnings could be equally interpreted as&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hey Vlad, no more Russians on the ground. Alright?"
Because if the U.S. does go forward with a no-fly zone over Syria ‚Äî essentially attacking Northern Syria and everyone in it ‚Äî Russia's acceptance of their own dead will only go so far until it potentially could turn into a much more serious standoff with the U.S. and Israel.&nbsp;
"There is a big danger that if you blow the SA-300 up you will kill a lot of Russians. I don't think the Israelis want to do that,"&nbsp;Robert Hewson, editor of IHS Jane's Air-Launched Weapons,&nbsp;said to the&nbsp;Guardian.

(Credit: Activision)
In this day and age, perhaps it's not the best idea to erect a life-size statue of a gunman and place it in the front window of your office.

Yet this is precisely what the Los Angeles Police Department confronted late Thursday night when officers stormed the building of game studio Robotoki. The LAPD, guns draw, faced off with a gun-wielding, very human-like replica of a soldier Simon "Ghost" Riley from Robotoki's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 -- that and a very startled Robert Bowling, the company's president, who happened to be working late that night.

You might think that the looming presence of a life-like gunman was what inspired the LAPD to raid the building. But actually, it was the result of an unknowing employee mistakenly hitting the panic button of the office's newly installed security system, according to gaming news site Polygon.

You may want to pick one of these up while you still can!

If I could single out one trait that I feel is sorely missing from modern cars, it would be "character." Today's automobiles are faster, safer, more fuel efficient and better made than at any previous time in history. But too many of them are lacking in character and originality.

That's why if I had to pick just one SUV or truck from the modern era destined for future classic status ‚Äî one that doesn't rhyme with "Shmaptor" or "Blightning," anyway ‚Äî I'd pick the Isuzu Vehicross. It oozes character in every conceivable way.

Let's check off all the ways the Vehicross is a unique snowflake in the most boring automotive landscape of all. A design that still seems futuristic today? Check. It comes from a much-beloved dead brand? Check. Sophisticated all-wheel-drive technology that makes it a highly-competent off roader? Check. General mechanical toughness? Check. Rarity? Check. Always designed to be a one-run niche vehicle? Check.

The Vehicross, or VehiCROSS if you're the kind of person who doesn't capitalize the "M" in "Mini", just hit a 20-year mark of sorts. The car began life as a concept at the 1993 Tokyo Auto Show, although it didn't hit production until 1997.

I remember seeing this thing back when it first debuted and thinking it was some kind of crazy electric car. I was wrong, but the car's spaceship-like looks are enough to convince anyone that it's far from ordinary, even today.

The Vehicross came out right as SUVs were starting to really hit their stride in terms of sales, the beginning of that kind of peak era that lasted until the early 2000s or so. I feel like it was a daring idea that took advantage of an exciting new segment.

It also came out back when people actually expected SUVs to be able to do off-road shit, before car companies realized that very few (if any) of their buyers were actually using them for that purpose. The Vehicross can hold its own when the pavement ends, baby.

Mounted on the Isuzu Trooper's chassis and packing a 3.5-liter V6 good for a still-healthy 215 horsepower and 230 lb-ft of torque, the Vehicross packs a rather advanced 4WD system. I'll let this 1999 article from Motor Trend break it down:

Under normal conditions, the system operates in rear-drive mode, but as conditions demand, torque is automatically transferred to the front axle to provide maximum grip. A display in the instrument cluster shows the driver how much torque is being routed to the front. One key difference between this and other automatic 4WD systems is that TOD uses a dedicated electronic control unit to oversee the process and draws upon input from 12 different input sensors. This collective input is continually compared to a preprogrammed 3D software map that determines how much torque to distribute to each axle, based on such parameters as vehicle speed, wheel speeds, and accelerator pedal angle, to monitor either actual or potential tire slippage. In this way, the system can actually begin correcting for traction loss before it's even occurred. For more demanding conditions, a low-range transfer case also is provided.

They also praised its lack of body roll and impressive handling that lacked the harsh ride of most SUVs. Pretty badass for a late 90s car, right? And not the kind of thing you find on wimpy small crossovers these days. Let's see your mom's CR-V do all that. Spoiler alert: IT CAN'T.

The party continues inside with a tasteful, classy, simple interior that includes Recaro seats up front. Recaros! On a small SUV! It may look a little dated, but it's honest, and it isn't overcooked like so many modern interiors are.

Tough, stylish, unique ‚Äî and underappreciated, like all great future classics. The Vehicross was only ever meant as a limited-production model. Just under 6,000 were ever made between 1997 and 2001, though the overwhelming majority of them were sent to the U.S.

But even with the intentional niche status, the car was never really a huge hit with buyers. As recently as 2010, Car and Driver was knocking it, saying Isuzu had to learn that "no one wants a three-door SUV that looks like an escapee from the set of Battlestar Galactica."

Y'all are a bunch of haters, man. Just writing about the Vehicross makes me want one. It's something truly different in an endless sea of pedestrian grocery-getters, and I have a feeling that one day, future generations will appreciate it more than we have so far.

And the best part is that while they aren't exactly plentiful, they are cheap. A recent search on Cars.com shows that one of these can easily be had for under $10,000. Those fancy 4WD gizmos could get expensive to repair, but the car is pretty robust overall. It's a great way to get a decent rock climber without spending a ton of dough.
Isuzus in general are hugely unappreciated, even though they cranked out some awesome machines before they went kaput. The Vehicross is one of them. And years from now, people may look back on it and think, "Man, I really should have bought one when I had the chance."

Maybe you should while you still can.
Future Classics is a new feature we're trying out on Fridays. What car from the last 15 years or so do you think will be sought after years from now? Feel free to give us some ideas in the comments.

Saving that much money is a challenge for most of us.
In some metropolitan areas, average home prices are very, very high, requiring a down payment of at least tens of thousands of dollars.
Nationally, the median price for an existing home is $192,800.
Traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages require a 20 percent down payment, or $38,560 on that median-priced home.
That figure does not include closing costs or any other related expenses, like moving or remodeling.
Alternatives to the 20 Percent Down Payment.
Buyers gather their down payment money in different ways. Some cash out investment accounts while others receive gifts from family members. But even those unable to pull together that much cash have options.
FHA Loan.
One of the most popular alternatives is the FHA loan, which is a loan issued by a traditional lender but guaranteed by the government. An FHA loan requires a down payment of just 3.5 percent (so for our median-priced home, only $6,748), but also requires payment of extra fees plus private mortgage insurance (PMI), typically rolled into the loan.
VA Loan.
VA loans are guaranteed by the Veterans Administration and are available to qualifying veterans and surviving spouses. VA loans do not require any down payment at all, nor do they require PMI.
Piggyback Loan.
Some buyers choose to make the down payment by taking out a second loan, called a piggyback loan. Common piggyback loans cover 10 percent of the purchase price, requiring the buyer to come up with 10 percent for a down payment and to finance the remaining 80 percent.
Other piggyback loans cover 5 percent for borrowers who make a down payment of 15 percent. Piggyback loans allow the borrower to avoid PMI.
More Options for the Borrowers with the Best Credit.
Borrowers with the best credit can obtain 100 percent financing from some banks, including Navy Federal and NASA Federal Credit Union. Other banks also offer financing for more than 80% of the home‚Äôs value to customers with significant assets held with the lender. Generally, those assets are held as collateral against a portion of the loan.
Does Size Really Matter?
Traditional wisdom in the past held that the larger a borrower‚Äôs down payment, the more invested he would be in the asset and the less likely to default. Research shows, however, that lower down payments are&nbsp;notcorrelated to a higher rate of foreclosure.
In fact, credit score and credit history are much stronger indicators of future financial behavior and the likelihood of foreclosure.&nbsp;Banks have nothing to lose by offering loan programs to buyers with great credit but less cash on hand.
A higher down payment will, however, bring better terms. The lowest mortgage interest rates are offered to borrowers who meet the strictest underwriting guidelines ‚Äì high credit score, 20 percent down, stable employment and so on.
On the flip side, lower down payments bring higher fees and interest rates, and PMI that in some cases covers the entire life of the loan. So the least cash flush among us are those who ultimately pay the most for the privilege of home ownership.
Your Options.
Most lenders will only finesse one aspect of the qualification process. In other words, if you have a lower credit score, be prepared to make a larger down payment.
Conversely, an outstanding credit score will open the door to a higher level of financing.&nbsp; If you have average credit and a low down payment, expect to look at the FHA program and pay a higher interest rate and additional fees.

"After Earth" is Smith's first non-sequel since "Seven Pounds," but the actor actually conceived the story as a potential franchise that would spawn its own sequels.
Yet unlike "Bad Boys" or "Men in Black," in which Smith was the star, the franchise was designed to ensure the ascent of Jaden Smith, not Will. It's just one of the projects the rapper-turned-movie-star has developed for his children with actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her brother Caleeb Pinkett through his Overbrook Entertainment production company.
See photos:&nbsp;'After Earth' to 'Whip My Hair': The Smith Family Showbiz Scrapbook.
Will Smith, who first became Hollywood royalty in "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" before moving over to film, has a much smaller part in "After Earth" than his progeny. According to an individual familiar with the planning of the movie, "After Earth" was envisioned as a trilogy.&nbsp;
By the time a third installment arrives in theaters, "Will will be too old to be an action star and Jaden will be just entering his prime," the individual told&nbsp;TheWrap.
Almost every element of the movie's website, from its trailer to its explanation of this futuristic world, begins with Jaden.&nbsp;The marketing campaign for the M. Night Shyamalan directed movie bears a striking similarity to earlier campaigns for Will Smith movies.
In 2008, Will Smith appeared in two movies, "Seven Pounds" and ‚ÄòHancock," that grossed a combined $792 million. Both of their posters consisted of nothing more than Smith's mug, his name and the movie's title. His visage, inscrutable yet familiar, distant yet desirable, was all it took to bring fans to the theater.&nbsp;

Now check out the poster for "After Earth." (pictured: above)
"You walk away thinking it looks like a great action movie starring Will Smith and his son and that his son is a legitimate star," a former marketing executive at a major studio toldTheWrap. "They did a great job of legitimizing him as a star without starting a conversation about why he should be legitimate. They show him flying through the air with this futuristic wing suit and people forget that is the same kid who was in 'Pursuit of Happyness.'"
Yet if Jaden is the focus of "After Earth," Will is the supportive parent -- literally. It is the second films in which he plays Jaden's father and the third he has produced, the third being none other than the hit "Karate Kid" remake starring Jaden.
"Overbook exists for the greater glory of Will and Jaden," one individual with knowledge of the company told TheWrap.
The Jaden Smith business is Will Smith's business, and Will Smith's business is the family business. The inclusive approach extends well beyond Jaden.
Overbrook acquired the rights to turn musical "Annie" into a film from Jay-Z‚Äôs film company, and the initial plan was for Will's daughter Willow&nbsp;(near left with Jaden)&nbsp;to star as the titular orphan. Already a successful singer who appeared with her father in "I Am Legend," she was deemed a natural fit after the success of her song "Whip My Hair."

Yet Willow eventually decided that she wanted to be a kid, practicing ballet and playing baseball. "Beasts of the Southern Wild" star Quvenzhane Wallis replaced her in the lead role.&nbsp;
Smith's brother-in-law Caleeb is the lead producer on "After Earth" and has assumed a growing role at Overbrook, which is run by Smith and his long-time producing partner James Lassiter. Pinkett co-wrote and developed the movie -- "The Legend of Cain" -- as the next act of the elder Smith's career -- the "Clint Eastwood part."
Smith would have starred in and directed "Cain,"&nbsp;one of several movies where he began to relinquish his action hero belt and pursue more diverse films. The project, like so many in Hollywood, is still in development.

Caleeb's gradual ascension within Overbrook comes at the same time that many key employees have departed the Sony-based outfit, including partner Ken Stovitz ‚Äì who now represents Jada and Jaden Smith as an agent at Paradigm ‚Äì COO Guy Primus and Black List founder Franklin Leonard.
Though Smith's representatives declined to comment on the record for this story or about dynamics at Overbrook, one individual close to the company suggested that anyone who says his ascension and those departures are related is merely bitter.
Overbrook declined to comment for this story, as did many of the people TheWrap contacted for this story. Smith is both powerful and well-liked, but guards his privacy; case in point, departing Overbrook employees must sign a non-disclosure agreement. People speak when permitted.

Privately, people said they feel Smith's efforts to work with his family and develop projects for them have been unobtrusive and sincere, contrasting his efforts favorably with certain reality show families.
(Cough *Kardashians* Cough).
When New York magazine&nbsp;asked&nbsp;Smith about one such showbiz family -- that would be the Kardashians -- he said that fame was not the name of the game in his family.
"We are trying to put great things into the world, we're trying to have fun, and we're trying to become the greatest versions of ourselves in the process of doing things we love," he told the magazine. "So the idea of fame or exploitation or orchestrating the media is sometimes even less than desirable for us."

He pointed out that Willow decided to bow out of "Annie" after they acquired the property for her, and they supported that decision.
"It may seem like we have pushed our kids into the business, but that is absolutely insane," he told the magazine. Jaden, he added, is making an informed decision to take on these high-profile roles.&nbsp;
Yet even Smith acknowledges that he approaches his business like a family business, and his business is one where celebrity and fame come whether you want it or not.
Jaden has embraced stardom with the same relish his father does, and became one of the youngest stars to court a following in the booming Chinese market when he starred in "The Karate Kid." The Smiths spent a great deal of time traveling through the country, aware of the all-important international box office.
See video:&nbsp;Will and Jaden Smith Take Father-Son Bonding to New Level in 'After Earth' Trailer.
With "After Earth," Overbrook again tried to tap into an emerging part of the business, even hiring someone to do transmedia specifically for the film.
"Jaden can get things done in this town," one manager who works with younger stars told TheWrap. "People like him and 'The Karate Kid' did so well internationally that he means something. Because of that, if 'After Earth' does any kind of business, he's golden."
Jaden has not booked the next film on his schedule, which could range from various projects in development at Overbrook to a sequel to "After Earth" ‚Äì if it performs.
Few expect the movie to be a huge hit domestically (factoring in its hefty budget), but Smith will use his enduring appeal overseas to make the movie profitable. Will that be enough to spawn a sequel, er, dynasty?
Stay tuned.

But it is sitting on a vast&nbsp;copper deposit and is about to be destroyed.
In the spring of 1963, a French&nbsp;geologist set out from Kabul to carry out a survey in Logar province in eastern Afghanistan. His destination was the large outcrop of copper-bearing strata in the mountains above the village of Mes Aynak. But in the course of boring for samples, the geologist stumbled on something much more exciting: an entire buried Buddhist city dating from the early centuries AD. The&nbsp;site was clearly very large ‚Äì he estimated that it covered six sq km ‚Äì and, although long forgotten, he correctly guessed that it must once have been a huge and wealthy terminus on the Silk Road.
Archaeologists in Kabul did a preliminary survey of the site, mapping it and digging test trenches, but before they could gather the enormous resources needed for a full-scale excavation, first the 1978 Marxist coup then the 1979 Saur Communist revolution and the Soviet invasion intervened. In the chaos of conflict that followed, the Soviets visited Mes Aynak to dig test tunnels into the hillside and investigate the feasibility of extracting its copper. Later, during the Taliban era, one of the abandoned Soviet tunnels became an al-Qaida hideout, while the remote valley became a training camp: the 9/11 hijackers stopped off here en route to&nbsp;New York. During the American onslaught of December 2001, US special forces attacked the tunnel: an unexploded rocket lodged in the roof and burn marks at the cave mouth still bear witness to the attack.
By the time French archaeologists returned in 2004, they found that the secret of the buried city was out. As had happened in many other sites in&nbsp;the country, a large and highly organised team of professional art looters, probably from Pakistan, had systematically plundered the mounds at Mes Aynak and, judging by the detritus they left, had found large quantities of hugely valuable Gandharan Buddha images: the remains of many painted stucco figures deemed too fragile or too damaged to sell were left lying around the looting trenches which now crisscrossed the site. Beside them, the archaeologists found empty tubes of glue and bags of fine plaster ‚Äì evidence of attempts at restoration and conservation.
Things did not begin well. The first set of guards placed on the site in 2004 ended up shooting each other in a gun-battle; indicating, presumably, that profitable looting was continuing long after the site had passed into Afghan government control. But it was now beyond dispute that Mes Aynak was a discovery of major significance. In the months that followed, the excavators uncovered 19 separate archaeological sites in the valley. These ranged from&nbsp;four fortified monasteries, a Zoroastrian fire temple and several Buddhist stupas (commemorative monuments), through ancient copper working, smelting workshops, miners habitations and a mint, as well as two small forts and a citadel. They also found a hoard of Kushan, Sassanian and Indo-Parthian coins, more than 1,000 statues, and several perfectly preserved frescoes showing donor portraits and scenes from the life of the&nbsp;Buddha.
As more data slowly emerged from the ground, it became clear that the site was a major Buddhist settlement, occupied from the first century BC and to the 10th century AD, at a time when South Asian culture in the form of the Buddhist religion and Sanskrit literature were spreading up the Silk Route into China, and when Chinese scholars and pilgrims were heading southwards to the Buddhist holy places of the Gangetic plain: Sarnath and Bodh Gaya, and the Buddhist university and library of Nalanda, the greatest centre of learning east of Alexandria. Mes Aynak was clearly an important stopping-off point for monks heading in either direction.
Then, in 2008, the Chinese returned, this time not as pilgrims or scholars but instead as businessmen. A Chinese mining consortium ‚Äì Chinese Metallurgical Group and Jiangxi Copper Co ‚Äì bought a 30-year lease on the entire site for $3bn (¬£2bn); they estimated that the valley contained potentially $100bn worth of copper, possibly the largest such deposit in the world, and potentially worth around five times the estimated value of Afghanistan's entire economy. Afghan president Hamid Karzai's government hailed the mine as a key component in bringing about a national economic resurgence that would not be dependent on aid and military spending ‚Äì which, between them, currently make up 97% of the legal economy ‚Äì or, indeed, the profits of the illegal opium trade. Some observers estimated that the project could bring in $300m a year by 2016 and provide about $40bn in total royalties to the Afghan government.
Copper had created the site and probably drew the Buddhist monks to the valley in the first place, but now it would imminently lead to its complete destruction. In order to retrieve what they could before the site was levelled, the archaeologists of the French Archaeological Mission in Afghanistan (Dafa) began a major rescue dig to which the Chinese contributed $2m, the US $1m and the World Bank $8m: by providing the cash, everyone hoped the mine would not be halted by protests ‚Äì the press had already begun comparing the destruction of the major Buddhist site at Mes Aynak to the dynamiting of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban in the summer of 2001.
As well as 200 armed guards, there is currently an international team of 67 archaeologists on site, a mixed group of French, English, Afghans and Tajiks. Serious technology is being deployed to record the remains: ground penetrating radar, georectified photography and aerial 3D images are being brought together to produce a comprehensive digital map of the ruins. This effort is being backed up by more traditional techniques: the sweat of about 550 pick-axe wielding Logari labourers. This summer that number is due to increase to 650. This will make Mes Aynak the largest rescue dig anywhere in the world.

To get to Mes Aynak you must make a mildly risky two-hour trip from Kabul. Logar is still the Taliban's principal route into Afghanistan from their Pakistani safehavens and the highway is frequently subject to IED attacks aimed at the Nato-led Isaf convoys.
I was driven to the site by Philippe Marquis, the ebullient director of Dafa, who is famed in Afghanistan not just for his bravery and archaeological prowess, but also for keeping the best table and the best wine cellar in Kabul. Marquis has masterminded the Mes Aynak project since its inception, and drives back and&nbsp;forth two or three times a week in&nbsp;his beret and dapper corduroy waistcoat, supervising both the digging&nbsp;on site and the fundraising and&nbsp;administration that takes place at&nbsp;the Dafa office in Kabul.
On a bright, cloudless spring day&nbsp;we&nbsp;drove together through the Kabul&nbsp;valley, past fortified mudbrick compounds surrounded by fields green with ripening barley and divided up with windbreaks of poplar. Eventually, we turned off the main road on to a bumpy track leading into the hills, in April still etched with drifts of snow. As&nbsp;we drew close, we found ourselves surrounded by the camouflaged and flak-jacket wearing guards of the Afghan army: an entire regiment armed to the teeth with heavy machine guns is at work in this remote valley to keep this lucrative Chinese investment safe.
Driving uphill past a succession of checkpoints, the small camp for the diggers and the huge Chinese mining compound with its conning towers, drilling pylons and lines of identical blue-roofed barrack blocks, we arrived at length in a high-altitude valley of stark magnificence. Here, the dark ruins stand out against the thick snowfields of the Koh Baba Wali rising behind. Barren grey-clay walls and mudbrick structures rose out of the ground, their original form eroded by 2,000 years of winter winds, so that from a distance all that seemed to remain, amid the diggers, wheelbarrows and string mapping grids, was a maze of brick walls. But Marquis could see order where I could not, and instantly identified the different sites and speculated on what they were once used for.
With Marquis in the lead, striding forward holding a ski stick, we marched up the hill. Handles of ancient&nbsp;amphorae, painted fragments of geometric decoration lay strewn around our feet like autumn leaves ‚Äì hundreds of broken shards poking out of the mud. At the top we dived into a succession of monastic complexes where lines of sitting Buddha statues faced onto small slate stupas with classical columns covered with plastic sheeting. On the walls, sometimes almost invisible, at other times startlingly vivid, were the outlines of&nbsp;delicate wall paintings on plaster. Some showed lines of standing Buddha&nbsp;figures holding lotus flowers;&nbsp;the images were arranged four&nbsp;on each wall, 16 in total for each&nbsp;chapel. Others&nbsp;showed the seated&nbsp;Buddha surrounded by a body halo and nimbus, the Bodhisattva Maitreya in a cape or&nbsp;the evil child-devouring yaksha Atavika who the Buddha miraculously converted to his&nbsp;dharma. Several images showed the magnificently booted Kushan noblemen in red and white robes who&nbsp;originally paid for the complex.
The valley, emphasised Marquis, was an important centre of copper mining in antiquity. In one place he pointed out an ancient centre of crushing, refining and smelting, where&nbsp;the diggers had found a blanket&nbsp;of fused copper slag 12m (40ft)&nbsp;high. Marquis believes the copper workings to be central to understanding the ruins. Given the unusual grandeur of the Buddhist temples and palaces in the settlement, Mes Aynak might once have been a theocracy like Tibet, with the monks exploiting the copper reserves as a source of power and profit, not unlike the Cistercian monks who dominated the pre-industrial economy in many parts of medieval France and England.

Mes Aynak seems to have remained a wealthy centre until a period of slow decline began in the eighth century; the settlement was finally abandoned 200 years later. The archaeologists have found a layer of ash and charcoal and smashed statues, which seems to have coincided with the slow rise of the Islamic Ghurid dynasty in the area. Already, stories of Afghanistan's former wealth had entered folklore. When the medieval physician Abu Ubaid al-Jizani was writing in the early 11th century, it was widely known that Afghanistan's former rulers "have been famous and celebrated from the most remote ages for the abudance of their riches, the vastness of their treasures, the number of their mines, and their buried wealth. For that country is littered with mines of gold, silver, rubies and crystal, as well as lapis and garnets and other precious things."
However, 500 years earlier, when Mes Aynak was at the peak of its prosperity between the fifth and seventh century AD, Buddhism was spreading over the Hindu Kush and the&nbsp;region was the meeting place for&nbsp;the ideas and peoples of the civilisations surrounding Central Asia. Its mountains and valleys were a major intellectual crossroads where the Hellenistic, Persian, Central Asian, Tibetan, Indian and Chinese worlds met and fused. Today, of course, part of what is so fascinating about the civilisation of the cities of the Silk Route is the sheer remoteness of these&nbsp;exotic-sounding places. Yet what&nbsp;most distinguished Mes Aynak in&nbsp;the early first millennium AD was the opposite: the fabulously wealthy and cosmopolitan nature of the society that thrived there.
At this period, Afghanistan was the epicentre of classical globalisation: midway on the trade route from Rome to China, traders came to Afghanistan from all over the world, bringing painted glass from Antioch, inlaid gold vessels from Byzantium, porphyry from Upper Egypt, ivories from South India, carpets from Persia, horses from Mongolia and Siberia, and lacquers and&nbsp;silk from the China coast. It was through these now-remote valleys that ideas of art, decorum, dress, religion and court culture passed backwards and forwards, east to west and back again, mixing and melding to create the most unexpected conjuctions. The slowly decaying remains of the culture that emerged from this extraordinary clash and fusion of civilisations still litters much of Afghanistan and northern Pakistan.
One of the centres of this process was the region of Gandhara, whose centre lay around Peshawar in the North-West Frontier province of Pakistan. After the death of Alexander the Great in 323BC the Greek garrisons of India and Afghanistan found themselves cut off from their Mediterranean homeland, and had no choice but to stay on, intermingling with the local peoples, and leavening Indian learning with classical philosophy. The Bactrian Greeks survived for 1,000 years, long after Greek civilisation had disappeared in Europe. Kings with names such as Diomedes of the Punjab, Menander of Kabul and Heliochles of Balkh, ruled over a remarkable Indo-Hellenistic civilisation that grew up in what is now the Taliban heartlands of the Federally Administered Tribal Agencies (Fata) and eastern Afghanistan. This civilisation was later cross-fertilised by new influences brought by the Kushans who succeeded the Bactrian Greeks as rulers of Afghanistan, while adopting much of their culture.
Kushan Gandhara was Buddhist in religion but worshipped a pantheon of Greek, Roman, Iranian, Hindu and Buddhist deities. It left behind it a legacy of finely constructed and richly designed Buddhist monasteries such as Mes Aynak. In the area between Kabul and Peshawar, one fifth-century Chinese traveller counted no fewer than 2,400 such shrines ‚Äì as well as a scattering of well-planned classical cities, acropoli, amphitheatres and stupas. Gandharan art used motifs borrowed from classical Roman art, with its vine scrolls, cherubs and centaurs, but its principal icon was a&nbsp;handsome, languid, meditating Buddha, dressed in a Greek toga.
The Hellenistic influence of Gandhara is immediately apparent at Mes Aynak ‚Äì in the Corinthian capitals that support the plinths on which the Buddha meditates; in the bearded tritons who seem to have wandered off some Mediterranean sarcophagus; and in the terracotta figures of ascetics that closely resemble those found at the Bactrian Greek site of Ai-Khanoum with their pointed goatee beards and intense wide-eyed stares. There is much Indian influence too. Several black-schist figures have been dug up&nbsp;showing the Buddha standing, meditating, preaching and fasting. In one image, now in the Kabul Museum and known as The Pensive Bodhisattva, the young Prince Siddhartha is shown sitting under a Pipal tree, clad in dhoti, turban and necklaces. His muscles ripple beneath the diaphanous folds of the toga. The saviour's hair is oiled and groomed. His face is full, round and classical: the nose small and straight; the lips firm and proud. Art historians believe the sculpture came from a workshop located at Bagram, under the US airbase whose notorious prison was recently handed over to the Afghans under pressure from Karzai.
Yet as time went on, Indian and western classical motifs increasingly give way to an ever-greater eastern influence, as the T'ang Chinese army&nbsp;moved along the sides of the Taklamakan desert and the Tarim basin to take over Xinjiang to the immediate north-west of Afghanistan. One of the most exquisite finds at Mes Aynak is a gilt Buddha head, with eyes half closed, poised on the threshold of enlightenment; it feels more Burmese than Central Asian. Fabulous frescoes reveal the increasing influence of both Uyghur and Chinese mural techniques: the compositions look increasingly like the work uncovered by the great turn-of-the-century Silk Road archaeologist Aurel Stein at the Cave of a Thousand Buddhas in Dunhuang. The delicacy of the silks, the elongated eyes, and the lightness of the brushstrokes depicting white iris-like flowers show the growing influence of T'ang Chinese art.
"In this ground," wrote Stein of the Silk Road cities he excavated, "time seems to have lost all power of destruction." The same is equally true&nbsp;of Mes Aynak.

The same process that can be seen in&nbsp;the art dug out of Mes Aynak ‚Äì a&nbsp;surprisingly strong western presence slowly giving way to Chinese influence from the east ‚Äì is a story that is likely to&nbsp;be repeated all over the region in the&nbsp;next few decades. For there is a&nbsp;growing conviction these days in Afghanistan that China could end up the ultimate winner here, after the US withdrawal in 2014.
Although the Chinese maintained close contacts with the Taliban regime and their Pakistani ISI backers during the 1990s, they pulled back from interfering in Afghanistan after the US-installed Karzai regime in December 2001, and, until recently, even economic contact was modest: last year there was only $234m in trade between the two neighbours. But this is now beginning to change.
In September 2012, the Chinese security chief, Zhou Yongkang, visited Kabul and announced a turnaround in&nbsp;Chinese policy. As well as signing contracts for more mining and oil exploration, the Chinese announced plans for road- and rail-building projects linking north-east Afghanistan with western China through the Wakhan Corridor. A railway is now being planned from Kashgar to Iran via&nbsp;Herat; another will run from Uzbekistan to Mazar-i-Sharif. China has&nbsp;also made a start on security co-operation with Karzai's regime, and is currently training a first batch of 300 Afghan policemen. The politics of this are delicate, but, potentially, extremely important. China is possibly the only&nbsp;country to which the Pakistani security establishment defers. If China continues to invest in Afghan mineral resources, and the roads and railways with which it can extract them, it will expect Pakistan to protect its interests and not allow the Taliban to disrupt these operations in Afghanistan. This could hold out the best hope for future peace in Afghanistan.
The potential is enormous. Geologists estimate that Afghanistan holds vast hydrocarbon and mineral deposits that could be worth $1tn ‚Äì including oil, gas, copper, iron, gold and lithium that China will need in the&nbsp;decades ahead if its economy is to&nbsp;expand. Yet Mes Aynak shows the scale&nbsp;of the problems that will have to&nbsp;be overcome. Most of the mineral deposits in Afghanistan are in the south-east of the country, where the Islamist insurgency is strongest. Despite massive investment in the fortified camp at Mes Aynak, and enormous security, there have been several Taliban attacks on the Chinese mining camp and most of the 150 Chinese staff in residence recently fled&nbsp;back home. One British observer who&nbsp;worked with the Chinese at Mes Aynak&nbsp;remains sceptical about their resolution: "They are scared, confused, and have little understanding of Afghanistan," he told me. "They may well be regretting ever having got involved in Mes Aynak. Their workmen are attacked ‚Äì there was another bomb&nbsp;last week, and they have no Dari&nbsp;or Pashto speakers. Rather than ruthlessly efficient, I have found them sweet and a bit hopeless." Certainly, their camp is currently empty except for security and caretakers.
In the meantime, excavations continue. Marquis says he has enough&nbsp;resources for a full rescue dig;&nbsp;what is&nbsp;not clear is how much time&nbsp;he has. Mining was due to begin in January, but the Taliban attack has given him at&nbsp;least until the summer to continue. How long he has after that remains unclear.

How Emotions Can Lead Investors Astray (BlackRock)
"Each person has a different perspective on the markets. But many admit that buying low may never feel 'right.' Oftentimes, emotional instincts drive investors to do the exact opposite. Being aware of your emotional state is important to making clearly reasoned investment decisions," according to BlackRock. Using hypothetical emotions and a hypothetical $100,000 investment they show how emotions can misguide investors.&nbsp;

Advisors Are More Optimistic About Their Business Than The Economy (Advisor One)
91% of advisors expect business to be better in 2013, that in 2012, but they're not as optimistic about the economy, according to a poll at SEI Advisor Network‚Äôs conference in Dallas. 41% expect "slow but consistent growth," 40% expect a near-term correction, and 13% expect a recession.
A Valuable Lesson From Pre-Retirees That Dumped Stocks In Early 2009 (Fidelity Investments)
A new report from Fidelity shows that 1.6% of pre-retirees, or the 55+ age bracket, that ditched stocks from their 401(k) by Q1 2009 and never rebalanced saw their balances grow 25.9%. Their average balance grew from $80,2000 to $101,000. Meanwhile, the average balance for pre-retirees nearly doubled from Q1 2009 to $255,000.&nbsp;
"There is a valuable lesson to be learned from the minority of pre-retirees who abandoned equities altogether and experienced significantly less progress," said James MacDonald, president, Workplace Investing, Fidelity Investments in a press release. ‚ÄúIt underscores the combined importance of a proper asset allocation and savings behavior as they planned for retirement within all that life entails."

A fictional autonomous robot fighter plane from the 2005 movie "Stealth."
Wikimedia Commons. Autonomous war robots are coming. Panicking about them will only make things worse.
Yesterday, a United Nations expert called for a halt and moratorium on developing "lethal autonomous robotics," or, in layman's terms, "killer robots."
His argument: once killer robots take part in war, there will be no going back. Christof Heyns, the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, told the Human Rights Council that now is the time to regulate and stop killer robots, arguing that "decisions over life and death in armed conflict may require compassion and intuition." He also urged the council to form a panel that would study whether international laws in place today adequately address the use of killer robots.

Thing is, killer robots already exist. And they're about the least compassionate machines we could imagine.

I'm talking about land mines, those notorious explosives that explode when walked over. Land mines are programmed to kill when certain conditions are met. That is the same principle guiding a killer robot.
But there are some key differences: A killer robot might make a decision based on algorithms and inputs, internal coding and pre-programmed combat behaviors. It might be programmed to understand the laws of war, and it might use surveillance technologies to make distinctions between unarmed civilians and armed combatants. The same principles that power facial recognition software could apply to robots targeting their weapons at other weapons, so they fire to disable guns and not to kill people.
Land mines, on the other hand, fail to distinguish between civilians and soldiers, between soldiers of different nations, and between animals or large children or small soldiers. Land-mine triggers cannot be easily shut off and are designed for durability not intelligence. At their worst, killer robots could be as deadly and as indiscriminate as landmines. Chances are, though, they will be much more sophisticated.

The task before lawmakers is not to ban a technology out of fear but to adapt the law to the technology once it exists. Making legislative decisions about new technology is tricky business. In the United States, electronic communication is governed by a law passed well before email was a regular fixture of life. Provisions that made sense to congressmen in 1986 trying to imagine email led to great weaknesses in privacy and personal security, all because the technology wasn't understood when the law was written. The stakes are much lower in governing electronic communications than in authorizing robots to kill.
Killer robots are coming. Efforts to halt their introduction or ban their development are not only likely to fail, but they'll drown out legitimate concerns about the safest way to implement the technology with Luddite fear-mongering.</div></a></div><div class="items-row" style="height:480px;"><a href="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650655/s/2cafde35/l/0Lartsbeat0Bblogs0Bnytimes0N0C20A130C0A50C310Cthe0Eweek0Ein0Eculture0Epictures0Emay0E310C0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650655/s/2cafde35/l/0Lartsbeat0Bblogs0Bnytimes0N0C20A130C0A50C310Cthe0Eweek0Ein0Eculture0Epictures0Emay0E310C0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:628px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="fcd919035c031600e636a075f12853728cda5ab5" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="375"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/xl/hq/fcd919035c031600e636a075f12853728cda5ab5"></figure><div><h2>Arts - nytimes.com</h2><h1>ArtsBeat: The Week in Culture Pictures, May 31</h1>A slide show of photographs of cultural highlights from this week.</div></a><a href="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650658/s/2cafc78f/l/0L0Sbusinessinsider0N0Ccolin0Epowell0Eexplains0Ebad0Eideas0Ein0Esyria0E20A130E5/story01.htm" data-url="http://operanfus.feedsportal.com/c/35144/f/650658/s/2cafc78f/l/0L0Sbusinessinsider0N0Ccolin0Epowell0Eexplains0Ebad0Eideas0Ein0Esyria0E20A130E5/story01.htm" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="0796d25dd6cf34b91ab6bbb41a1dee25dedf3d97" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="374"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/0796d25dd6cf34b91ab6bbb41a1dee25dedf3d97"></figure><div><h2>Business - businessinsider.com</h2><h1>Colin Powell Perfectly Explains The Quagmire That Is US Action In Syria</h1>The U.S., U.K., and France are all considering varying degrees of intervention in the Syria conflict, one of which is a so-called "no-fly zone."
However, in a recent interview with Bloomberg Television, former Secretary of State Colin Powell perfectly outlined why such an intervention could turn into a quagmire the U.S. cannot afford.
From Bloomberg:
‚ÄúWe have to be very, very careful with some of the, ‚ÄòWell, let‚Äôs just go in and start bombing, let‚Äôs just go in and put in a no-fly zone.' I wouldn‚Äôt like a no-fly zone. If you want to take out the Syrian air force, take it out. Don‚Äôt just fly around in circles waiting for it to come up. That won‚Äôt be hard to do. But you have to understand, if that doesn‚Äôt work, are you then committed to take the next steps?‚Äù
What Powell is saying here is that if that initial punch of setting up a no-fly zone doesn't knock Assad out of office, the U.S. is effectively caught in the breach ‚Äî forcing the administration to possibly take more drastic action.
A risky move for sure, especially with an American public who is deeply opposed to the idea of even any amount of intervention in Syria.

If you properly plan ahead, you can have the cold stuff sitting in your fridge when you wake up. But if you forget to prep ahead of time, it's time to brew and chill quick. Stack Exchange users provide a few tips on getting a cold fix, fast.

I brew coffee using a french press. After I've pressed it, how can I make it chill fast?
See the original question. Caleb answers:
Brew it strong and then add ice. Alternately, freeze some coffee in ice cube trays and use those frozen coffee cubes to chill the new batch without diluting it. Agitation (shaking) with cubes is a good substitute for crushed ice‚Äîboth ensure that the hot coffee meets the cold surface of the ice quickly. If you sweeten your iced coffee, using chilled simple syrup will help cool the brew and avoid problems getting the sugar to dissolve (sugar doesn't dissolve well in cold liquids). BaffledCook answers:
You could try the cold-infusion technique described by Harold McGee at the New York Times: You can improvise a cold-brewing system using a French-press pot or just a pitcher or bowl, with fine sieves, cheesecloth, or cloth or paper filters to strain out the grounds. Infuse coarsely ground coffee overnight in cold water, about 5 cups for every 1/2-pound of coffee, then press or filter the brew from the grounds. In my experience this can become tedious because fine particles clog the filters. SamtheBrand answers:
Make your coffee hot, then combine several easy methods to dissipate heat: Pour your hot coffee into a metal cup (or a martini shaker), which has better heat transfer properties than ceramic or glass. For even quicker results, plan ahead by frosting the metal cup in the freezer.Put the full metal cup in an ice bath. For an even colder ice bath, add salt, which can lower the temperature due to an effect known as freezing-point depression.Dip a metal spoon in and out of the full cup. (Note: dipping is more effective than stirring.) If making hot coffee cold quick is what you're after, you'll have a hard time finding a more effective method than this.

What if I'm full of shit?
Truth be told, I don't really know how the car is to drive though I critiqued the handling, and I shot down the styling even though the newly chromed front end really isn't awful in black. Voice of reason pauljones checked me as such.

Easy, Orlove.
We don't know anything about it how it drives yet. Styling is subjective, though I would agree it's not particularly exciting here. It's not bad, though, for a mid-size sedan. It's certainly better than the Camry or the Altima. LEDs are over-rated and often callously used, so the lack of them here is actually somewhat refreshing. As for the categories of "aspirational" and "a feeling of luxury," it's a goddamn Chevrolet, not a Lexus. Aspirational luxury is not the goal here, and it never has been, so don't judge it on that.
As for technology, fuel economy, and handling, those are things you can't know without driving it. You can make a guess based either on the 2013 Malibu and its inherent shortcomings or based on bullshit emotionalism, but give it the benefit of the doubt until you actually drive it. It may well suck, but then again, it may not. A great deal can be done to improve a car from model year to model year.
Remember when the third-gen WRX first came out in 2007? It sucked balls. Subaru fucked it up, realized it, and fixed it the next year. All on the same generation of car, and all within a model year. It's possible (though how probable it is can be debated) that the same thing may happen here. Stranger things have happened, after all.
And, also, as a fan of vanilla malts, you may stick the vanilla ice cream comparisons in where the sun don't shine. Vanilla ice cream is awesome.

Hey, maybe being acceptably inoffensive really is the secret to market success for GM. Take a look at the depressing sales numbers of the significantly more daring Mazda 6 if you want proof of that. Brststlnd pointed that out to me.

My argument is that you can't really fault it for just being what it is. It's basic, reliable transportation that offers itself as cheaper option to its competitors... Southwest Airlines has built one hell of a business flying people all over the country with their Malibu-of-the-skies philosophy.

Dekone hammered me down point-by-point on my rather childish bullet list.

By no means do I love this car but: styling - It's as good as anything else in it's price bracketexcitement - This is a silly marketig term. Means nothingcutting edge technology - uh, you definately worked in marketing prior to Jalopnika sense of drama - This post is drama..."like OMG, did you see the new Malibu? It's like so lame. Epic fail. OMG"a feeling of luxury - you expect luxury in a car that will roll off lots for about $18k brand new after rebates?an aspirational badge - I guess this means the Corvette sucks too?LEDs - The only people who pine over LEDs are middle school boys and asshats who drive S4'sclass-leading fuel economy - this only real legitimate gripe in this list. This is important in this segment. A miss by GMhandling - For $18k? Really? Do you also expect a valet when you pull up at McDonalds?pride of ownership - You have to own one first. This car will be leased and or financed with $0 down over 99 years.....the market for this car doesn't have pride in their cars. Ever.

And why should you even give a flying shit about my opinion? I haven't even been within 600 miles of this car, unlike Dodge, who says he's been much, much closer.

I think you need to get writer who has actually fully experienced the Malibu in each trim level, with driving experience. And maybe has some people to validate what GM is working on. I worked for GM Fairfax II Plant (where Malibu is assembled) while I was finishing up college this last year and got to drive the cars. And also both my folks work there too. Driving wise the cars are awesome, felt that engine and trans matched up great. More fun to drive than is advertised, and feels tight like I think more new cars should.
Trim and backseat could of been matched up better. From what I saw from "ACTUAL" pictures of refresh, which is something you should invest in getting a inside man for; was way roomier backseat and better design cabin trim level. And these were direct photos on parents co-workers phone, NOT some cheesy media shots. I think you will be more surprised than you think. If you remember 5 months ago when everyone said they hated new interior of of Silverado in spy shots, but when public saw it in person everyone loved it.
And just so you know should check Fords specs. Since there normal gas motors only achieve 1-2 miles per gallon better than Malibu's base motor.
FYI I'm a truck guy and I drive Dodge truck. So my opinion isn't one sided completely. I just think you should experience and get more fact before writing a junk article.

And even if this thing isn't perfect, there's a lot to look forward to, says becauseCAR, who met the man leading the team for the next 'Bu.

I actually met the current lead engineer of the Malibu back in November when GM was looking for engineers from UC Berkeley. He had only been back at GM for a few months, and had little influence on the final rollout. I ended up bringing up the Malibu with him and he said it was going through a major redesign, which everyone knew at the time.
The cool thing about him is that he engineered the 2003 Accord, which is one of the best Accords ever made, and worked at Harley-Davidson in a lead R&amp;D role, so I still have hope for the Malibu. The issue is we have to wait another four or five years.

What do you think? Maybe the Malibu isn't a bland, uninspiring, middle-of-the-road turd as my last article implied?</div></a><a href="http://www.dwell.com/post/article/photography-focus-simon-devitts-portrait-house" data-url="http://www.dwell.com/post/article/photography-focus-simon-devitts-portrait-house" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="e89c88f14e8525b8e1967d27efbd39348f4b42e7" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="380"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/e89c88f14e8525b8e1967d27efbd39348f4b42e7"></figure><div><h2>Living - dwell.com</h2><h1>Photography Focus:

Simon Devitt's Portrait of a House
New Zealand photographer Simon Devitt has been capturing homes and homeowners in for close to fifteen years.
His new book, Portrait of a House, Devitt collaborates with graphic designer Arch MacDonnell of Inhouse Design.
Portrait of a House is a photo album of the Athfield House or "The Village on the Hill" known by Wellington, New Zealand locals.
The Athfield House is an architectural experiment started by Ian Athfield in 1965 on the Khandallah hillside in Wellington. It's quite reminiscent of the Mos Eisley Cantina on the planet Tattooine, in Star Wars, Episode IV.
The idea for this photo book came from Devitt's inspiration from other shelter photo books such as Robin Morrison's 1978 book Images of a House.
"A house is a pretty refined subject to make a book about," explains Devitt. "It is not market driven, it is

Jonathan has been described as a "strange bird" among the GP crew -- though we mean it in the most affectionate sense. He certainly has an eclectic skill set: a Masters Degree in taxation paved the way for his full-time job as a tax accountant, but before all that this numbers man also figured out how to deftly craft copy, all the while bussing tables, running a "debt-laden" eBay store and toweling off tennis pros. His passions run wide and deep. Photography, cars, sports, arguing the finer points of Shiner Bock and his other favorite beers -- none are spared his attention. All of these things are firmly rooted in his sometimes obscene, always diabolically funny sense of humor. He might not always be entirely tasteful, but he's got a damn good taste in gear.</div></a><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/fashion/the-new-baby-name-anxiety.html?partner=rss&emc=rss" data-url="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/fashion/the-new-baby-name-anxiety.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 6px; top: 6px;" data-id="43dcab09afa3fc7dcc24e40052fdc7ceea6721f0" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="383"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/43dcab09afa3fc7dcc24e40052fdc7ceea6721f0"></figure><div><h2>Lifestyle - nytimes.com</h2><h1>First Person: The New Baby-Name Anxiety</h1>Many prospective parents feel paralyzed trying to come up with a name for their baby, working to find the elusive name that is exotic yet not bizarre, classic yet not pompous, on trend but not trendy.</div></a><a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/whats-the-time-matteo-pericoli-to-the-5-boroughs" data-url="http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/whats-the-time-matteo-pericoli-to-the-5-boroughs" class="item" style="width:308px; height:468px; left: 326px; top: 6px;" data-id="06dedb5567ebc9ded2d6d983b2757b0bed25c346" data-handler="click_article" tabindex="384"><figure style="height: 320px" data-url="http://recsys.op-cdn.net/assets/tn/l/hq/06dedb5567ebc9ded2d6d983b2757b0bed25c346"></figure><div><h2>Arts - juxtapoz.com</h2><h1>What's the Time?: Matteo Pericoli "To the 5 Boroughs"</h1>We are about to close the chapter on our special month of Beastie Boys' coverage in conjunction with our June 2013 Beastie Boys issue, and we thought it was the right time to concentrate on one of the Boys' most personal albums, To the 5 Boroughs.

Michael Eavis's guide to Somerset.Retail therapy
Pearl Lowe, musician turned designer
Somerset's towns offer some fantastic shopping. Take Poot in Frome , which is filled with the prettiest dresses from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Hayley, the owner, has a fantastic eye for some real gems. Make and Mend, also in Frome , is great for men's vintage suits, vintage dresses and odd bits of furniture. And Antique &amp; Country, (43-44 Vallis Way, Frome) has splendid chandeliers and gifts. A lot of the stuff in my house is bought from La Belle √âtoffe in Frome , which has fantastic French antique furniture.
In Bath, Susannah is the most wonderful shop filled with French lace and linens. The perfect place to buy presents, it's my favourite shop in the world. And if you're in Bruton, do not miss the eclectic mix of antique furniture, trinkets and clothes at Phillips &amp; Skinner. Back in Frome, Dores and Rees is the best auction house in the south-west, and a must for people kitting out their houses or flats on a budget. Finally, Frome reclamation yard is great for roll-top baths, sinks, doors, floorboards and everything housey.The Traveller's Rest
Billy Bragg, singer-songwriter
The A37, which runs in an almost straight line between the A303 and the turn-off to the festival site at Pilton, is a remnant of the Fosse Way, the Roman road that connected Lincoln with Exeter. In the early years of the Roman occupation, this was the western border of the Roman Empire, keeping the passive Britons apart from the unruly tribes beyond the Fosse. The festival lies on that unruly side and every year the tribes still gather to celebrate their culture. With its pub sign depicting a weary Roman centurion, The Traveller's Rest, on the A37 at East Pennard, offers the only visible reminder of those times. Stop there for a pint of Fosseway cider.

Julian Temple, film director
I remember taking Joe Strummer to the Bridgwater Carnival when he first came to live in Somerset. It was a freezing November night, and I wasn't sure what he'd make of it. I needn't have worried ‚Äì the first float to come swaying around the corner, pulled by a mud spattered tractor was blasting out [Joe's song] Rock the Casbah. The glare of what seemed like a million naked light bulbs lit up a vision of scantily clad local beauties, belly dancing as though their lives depended on it. The crowd roared, hurling coins at the float.Joe turned to me. "This is my kind of town," he grinned.
He was right: little do people know as they drive past Bridgwater on their way to the chocolate-box cream tea world of Exmoor and beyond, that they are missing a trick. In early November each year, coinciding with the Day of The Dead in Mexico and Bonfire Night, cider meets samba in this uniquely renegade town. For over 150 years the people of Bridgwater have defied the odds, overcoming economic hardship and change, keeping the spirit of their community alive all year round with elaborate preparations and fundraising for this spectacular carnival. Wrap up warm and come on down and join us in cider space ... for a true taste of Anarchy in the UK!

Simon King, naturalist, broadcaster, president of the Wildlife Trusts (wildlifetrusts.org)
If you fancy a bevvy, head for the Talbot Inn (01373 812254, talbotinn.com) in Mells near Frome. It has a cosmopolitan feel, with great honest food and a fun vibe. For retail therapy, Catherine Hill in Frome is probably the only place in the world where you can stroll from an astronomical telescope shop to a burlesque clothing shop to a fab coffee house to a well-stocked model shop all within 50m. And of course, there is the countryside, with everything from lowland marsh to heath to ancient woodland and moorland, tidal mudflats and rocky coastline. Westhay Heath and Shapwick Heath reserves on the Levels are both heaving with booming bitterns, otters and egrets. Walk the Parrett river
John Shearlaw, Glastonbury festival press officer
Bridgwater finishes an untrumpeted and distant second in most conventional travel appraisals. It's home to the world's second-largest illuminated carnival (behind Rio de Janeiro), and close to the country's second-oldest Area of Outstanding Beauty, the Quantock Hills. But yet another runner-up ‚Äì the Parrett river, boasting the second-highest tide range in the world ‚Äì is the key to the town's former glories. The first wealth came from religious pilgrims bound for Glastonbury Abbey, who crossed the Parrett by foot at nearby Combwich. Seventeen centuries later the river trade in wool from Langport through Bridgwater brought status and prosperity. By 1843 the former's Stuckeys Bank had holdings only marginally smaller than the Bank of England's. Not much of the gloss is immediately visible, but a walk down the 50-mile River Parrett Trail reveals some of the county's hidden soul. End the day at the Green Olive Turkish meze restaurant on Bridgwater's quayside. The Sheppey Inn, Godney
Lucinda Garland, director of Strummerville music charity
The Sheppey Inn is a rare place that leaves you with a smile. Hidden away on the Somerset Levels with the Glastonbury Tor nearby, it's unpretentious and super laid-back. The small wooden door brings you straight into to the bar, which sets the tone for the place ‚Äì it's rustic and all that, and there are snugs and crevices, but it's also clean and shiny and friendly, with good booze. I love the cider and mead cocktail ‚Äì innocent, frothy and lethal. The big barn-like eating area is bright and airy and sits on the river ‚Äì fab in summer with the doors wide open. There's a great big deck for outside drinks and fags on the river. There are funny touches all over the place like the Spanish dancer loo roll dolls on tables or a Ken Doll doing press-ups ‚Ä¶all a bit random but that's balanced by big retro overhead lighting, and it's the kind of place where a waitress who's also an artist is showing her work. On the menu are great burgers, noodles, salady things and grills served on large wooden boards. The chips are stunning. I remember one Sunday lunch where we had the most amazing lime pudding, a cheesecake in a pot, rather unassuming, but the flavour and zing wowed us all.

Abi Small, Glastonbury festival press officer
Wilkins Cider Farm, known as Mudgley's to locals, is one of my favourite places in Somerset. My first visit was for a friend's birthday, when 20 of us, all in fancy dress, spent the day drinking Roger's famous, purportedly psychedelic, farmhouse scrumpy, chatting merrily with the legend himself and eating local cheeses and pickles. This all led to running around the farm, hide and seek in the hay barn and generally playing like proper country children, then later on, propping ourselves up against the huge oak barrels in the shed. The charm of this place is that Roger Wilkins doesn't raise an eyebrow at any of this ‚Äì just his gert big flagon of cider.
‚Ä¢ 01934 712385, wilkinscider.com. Quantock Hills
Suki Lilienthal, owner of Parsonage Farm B&amp;B, Over Stowey
A good way to counterbalance a festival of thousands in a field is to take a drive westward from Glastonbury and visit the beautiful Quantock Hills. There you will be sharing fields and moors with sheep, wild horses and a few other walkers. Nether Stowey is where Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in the late 1700s when he wrote the Ancient Mariner and Coleridge Cottage owned by the National Trust, is worth a visit. William and Dorothy Wordsworth lived for two years in nearby Holford and together with Coleridge, they wandered the coombes and hills writing poetry. Holford is an excellent place to begin a walk on the miles of public footpaths. Visit the rocky beach at Kilve, Somerset's own Jurassic coast, overlooking the Bristol Channel with fossils, cliff walks and cream teas at the Chantry Tea Gardens, in the ruin of an ancient chantry. Three miles away over the moor is the Carew Arms in Crowcombe where the front bar hasn't changed since the days of Coleridge.View from Deer Leap
Tessa Munt, MP for Wells
The favourite view in my patch is of the Somerset Levels and beyond which can be seen at Deer Leap, near Ebbor Gorge, between Wells and Priddy. From this spectacular vantage spot on a clear day, you can see Wells Cathedral and Glastonbury Tor, over to Brean Down and across the Bristol Channel to Wales. It doesn't matter how many times I see it, this view still takes my breath away.Bath farmers' market
William Edwards, 15, Michael Eavis's grandson
Being the oldest farmers' market in the country (established 1997) the Bath Farmers Market really shows off the capability of the agriculture here in the heart of Somerset. Located in Green Park Station (an disused Victorian railway station. It is the perfect place to gather your ingredients for a Sunday roast you'll never forget. I've spent many Saturday mornings waking up at 6:30am to sell the cheddar cheese made with milk from farms around Glastonbury.bathfarmersmarket.co.uk.GlastonburyFestivalsBars and clubsWalking holidaysGlastonbury 2013Glastonbury festival

Dear Snob, I was recently admiring the Patek 5205G-001 (online
-- I can't afford even to step into a Patek boutique), but something was bothering me. I
finally figured out what it was: The font size of "Patek
Philippe Geneve" seemed too big for the space. This got me noticing the different size
fonts that are used in other watches by Patek and its peers. It seems to me that far too
much space is being given to the company name, when something smaller would be more
tasteful. If you have the money to buy a really fine watch, do you really need your
friends to be able to read the maker from across the table? I know
that you have very definite ideas about big watches, but do you have anything similar to
say about big font sizes for company names on watch faces? What is the ideal size (or
relative size), in your opinion? I‚Äôve never given much thought to
watch names on dials, except in the case of individual design missteps that have marred an
otherwise nice watch. What I have found a disturbing trend is the printing of too much
text on the dial, as if we require the full owner‚Äôs manual or specification dossier
when we glance at our wrists for the time. I‚Äôve often thought this to be the
practice of an insecure brand, like the unrefined chap at a cocktail party who feels the
need to boast a little too loudly about his exploits. Omega
is perhaps the most egregious offender, with its multiple subtitles and depth ratings
taking up far too much space. But back to your point, fonts do seem to have
grown over the years. If one looks at a 1970s Royal
Oak, for example, the Audemars
Piguet name is almost illegible to the naked eye. The modern version has a much larger
font, perhaps in response to the declining eyesight of its target market, the baby boomer
spending his son‚Äôs inheritance. To my mind, the ideal size of a logo or dial font
would be a complete absence, with the design speaking for itself, instantly recognizable
for what it is. But off the top of my head, I can‚Äôt think of a single watch that
does this, and, therefore, a challenge has been laid.
Black Watches
I have seen a lot lately in regard to the new trend of wearing all black watches
(i.e. black face, band, material). Is this a new, short-lived trend or something to jump
on board? I already have an Omega
Speedmaster that I've had for a few years and am just looking to add something
different to wear at times. Any advice on this trend and any watch suggestions in regard
to this trend would he great. Are you asking for my permission to buy an
all-black watch? Sorry to disappoint you, but I have never warmed to this trend, which was
started by Porsche Design in the 1970s. Leave it to the Germans to be so severe. Black
watches look cheap and are so limiting, only properly matching with a wetsuit, Kevlar vest
and wool balaclava, none of which I find myself wearing terribly often.
Keen And Ebel
"Lets get right to the point: No, Ebel is not on par with Omega, Rolex or Breitling. Then
again, neither are the prices." I am willing to bet real money (not bitcoins) that you
will regret those words. Not for the branding preference you have displayed, but for your
ignorance. You, mon cher "Snob," are a watch brand victim -- not a snob at all. Much like
those petite size 1s promenading around in their Barbara Bui outfits, thinking they look
like the models who touted them down the runways, you wear a watch wrapped in the illusion
of quality its brand brings to the table. Pity. I thought you knew
what you were talking about. You sound like a Russian arriviste; you know, the one who
lost his arm in a car accident and complained he'd lost his Rolex? You might know
something about marketing, but, I dare say, you've displayed scant knowledge of watches
per se. You should study your Beau Brummel. Would
you like a job? Your sassy litany of put-downs is impressive, however misguided, and

More Somerset tips from celebrities and local experts.
'I've got the local paper from the day I was born, and there's a letter in there complaining about pagans running around naked on Glastonbury Tor," says Michael Eavis. "So you can't blame it on us!"
I'm in Glastonbury with the founder of the 43-year-old festival, discussing the town's propensity to attract hedonists and bohemians.
Eavis was born at the family farm just east of Glastonbury in 1935, 35 years before the first Glastonbury festival, which proves his point that any link between the freaks who populate the town and those who descend on the festival each year is purely coincidental. It seems hippies, crusties, new-agers and the like were being drawn to Glastonbury many decades, or even centuries, before such labels had even been concocted.
The Tor is at the focal point of the many mysteries that have surrounded the area for millennia: Avalon became associated with Glastonbury in the 12th century, when monks at the abbey claimed to have discovered the remains of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere; legend has it that Joseph of Arimathea travelled here after Jesus's crucifixion; and archaeological evidence suggests this was a sacred region from as early as 4000BC.
By the late 19th century, when the Victorians were busy elaborating Celtic mythology, the area's reputation as a spiritual, utopian community was well-established. Today, parts of Somerset, such as the towns of Frome and Bruton, are becoming fashionable and attracting pop stars and designers from London, but the hippy element remains strong, particularly in Glastonbury itself. The druids and the goddess worshippers have never really gone away.
Michael has agreed to spend a morning showing me around this patch of the county in his old red Land Rover, pointing out attractions that are overlooked by the festival-goers. With many people now spending a whole week at the festival, it's a shame, he says, that more don't bother to leave it and spend a little time exploring the county's ancient myths and natural understated beauty.
And outside of festival time, most tourists tend to miss out Somerset altogether, bombing through it on the M5 on their way to the more obvious charms of Devon and Cornwall.
"Somerset isn't chichi pretty like Devon and Cornwall," says Michael. "It's a real, working county." Or, as a friend of his we bump into puts it: "It's not all cream teas and National-Trusted up [like its tourist-orientated neighbouring counties]. You have to dig a little here, but there's plenty of soul under the grunge."
We began our search in Burnham-on-Sea, Michael's favourite Somerset spot, a quintessentially English seaside resort with a faded Victorian promenade.
"For me this place is about the whole history of coming here as a kid, on the train with Sunday school: sandcastle competitions on the beach, saying grace before we ate our jam tarts. And later I did all my courting in Burnham. It's a very humble place. There's no razzmatazz. It's laid-back and unspoilt ‚Äì which is why I still love it. I come back every couple of weeks to walk the dogs out to the lighthouse."
Burnham seems to have changed little since those Sunday school outing days, apart from a concrete sea wall built to protect the town from the tides. On the other side is a long dramatic sweep of empty sandy beach, with a distinctive nine-legged wooden lighthouse and views out to the mudflats and south Wales on the other side of the Bristol Channel.
"The putting green's gone now ‚Ä¶" Michael muses as we leave Burnham and turn inland to the Somerset Levels. The locals often call this area the Moors, even though much of this unique landscape ‚Äì one of the lowest, flattest areas in the country ‚Äì lies below sea level. In ancient times this land, being too wet to be used in winter, was called the Summerlands, which is possibly the origin of the name Somerset. We zigzag through a tapestry of fields of sheep and Scottish longhorn cattle and farming villages to the Natural England visitor centre at Shapwick Heath, which covers over 500 acres and contains the Sweet Track, a Neolithic causeway built in 3806BC, one of the oldest roads in the world.
"This is what the Levels is all about," says Michael. "Here you've got a combination of wildlife and birds as well as history. It's full of birdsong in spring: there are cuckoos everywhere. You can walk for miles from here on trails they've created on recycled plastic pallets. You can watch the otters, which have taken off big time here ‚Ä¶ In fact they are multiplying at such a rate I fear the fisherman will say enough's enough ‚Ä¶ which is why the otters were done away with in the first place!"
Another recent addition to the area's wildlife is the enormous murmurations of starlings who migrate to the Levels in winter and fill the skies at sunset with spectacular aerial displays. "The starlings are a huge draw in Somerset now," says Michael. "Millions of them come to roost in the reeds. I love to see them, but for a farmer they're trouble ‚Äì they'll eat all your maize."
Most of Michael's observations are peppered with references to farming and the county's strong work ethic. "Not much unemployment around here, I'll tell you," he says proudly as he waves to an old farming colleague. "We're busy all the time."
And no one more so than Michael. He has squeezed in our meeting between being the after-dinner speaker at the county's beekeepers' convention the night before and an engagement with the Diocese of Somerset tonight. And then there's the festival to plan ‚Ä¶
To the north of the Levels lie the Mendip Hills, the setting for Somerset's most dramatic landmark, Cheddar Gorge, the deepest canyon in Britain, the site of the Cheddar show caves and home to Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, the 9,000-year-old Cheddar Man, who was found in 1903.
"The Mendips are fantastic for walkers," says Michael. "My favourite is Ebbor Gorge, which goes from the Levels to about 300m. There are no people or buildings, just sheep. And there are some terrific views over the Levels when you get to the top of the gorge.
"I'm not really a drinker but there's an amazing pub up in the Mendips, the Hunter's Lodge Inn in Priddy (01749 672275) run by a lovely old couple." The pub is a step back in time ("They haven't mucked about with it," says Michael, approvingly), serves good local ale and attracts cavers. In fact there's a cave right outside the pub: the Hunter's Lodge Inn Sink, one of many in the area. Priddy is also home to an annual folk festival, a sheep fair, which has been held since 1348, and a summer gypsy festival which draws people from all over the country to buy and sell horses.
Back on Glastonbury High Street it seems ‚Äì at least to a cynic like me ‚Äì that people come from all over the country to buy hippy tat. "The shops are totally unique here" says Michael, as we walk through town. He's not wrong there. It is unlike any high street I've seen: the shops have names like Natural Roots (A Non-Toxic Salon), Hemp Avalon, Sufi Charity Shop, Man, Myth &amp; Magik (sic), and Cat &amp; CauLdron (sic again). It feels like it's stuck in a 1960s time warp, but there's clearly a market for all this spiritualist paraphernalia. Revealing that work ethic again, Michael says: "I've read this is the only high street in England that hasn't got a shop to let. Isn't that amazing?"
After saying goodbye to Michael I walk up the Tor, the 158m conical hill, topped by St Michael's Tower, that rises out of surrounding plains to dominate the landscape. It is easy to imagine it as it once was, rising as an island from the waters. There are no naked pagans today (it's a little early in the day, and far too cold) but it's still an evocative spot, with all its Arthurian legend and Celtic myth.
It rises in a series of seven manmade symmetrical terraces that are the Tor's oldest mystery, and from the top there are views south-east to Dorset and east to Wiltshire as well as back over the Levels we've spent the morning driving around. From here it's a patchwork of villages and fields criss-crossed with glistening irrigation channels all the way to the Bristol Channel, with the Mendips to the north and the Quantock Hills to the south. And while I'm too much of a skeptic to feel the energy of the Tor's fabled ley lines, the view from up here is quite magical.

And by staying in rented flats instead of hotel rooms.
The first summer my husband and I went to Italy, we were young, poor backpackers. We did one of those "if it's Tuesday it must be Rome" holidays, visiting too many cities in too short a time, travelling by train, feasting on cheese and salami and cheap red wine, and staying in cheap but far from cheerful two-star hotels. We loved it all the same.
I remember catching the vaporetto down Venice's Grand Canal, gazing up at the obviously more affluent tourists sipping prosecco in glasses (not plastic cups) on palazzo terraces (not windowsills), and I think I actually sighed. I know I thought: "We're going to holiday like that one day."
Smitten with Italy ‚Äì particularly with its fantastic food ‚Äì we returned, each time staying longer. We hired a car and drove around, spending longer ‚Äì several days, sometimes a week ‚Äì in each place. But still we stayed in hotels, albeit nicer ones. We were a little older, but not yet wiser ‚Äì because in Italy extra euros might get you a better bathroom and glassware, but it doesn't always buy extra space. We didn't yet realise we could be renting an apartment for a fraction of the price.
We began to seek out more interesting, idiosyncratic and intimate hotels. And that's when we started to think about how we really like to travel. In Italy, small boutique hotels are often on back streets, tucked into forgotten corners of quaint, quiet neighbourhoods. It's amazing what a difference location makes: being in those out-of-the-way spots gave us a taste for everyday life beyond postcard images of washing on balconies and old people gossiping on park benches.
The next year, we took things a step further, booking a studio in a centuries-old palazzo in Venice that I found on an estate agent's website. Located at the end of a skinny alleyway, slap-bang between Cannaregio and Castello, two of Venice's least touristy sestieri (districts), it really felt like a secret. We had to convert our sofa into a bed each night, the bathroom was bigger than the kitchen, and we didn't have that terrace I coveted. In fact, our two tiny balconies weren't much bigger than the two-star windowsills where we'd sipped vino years earlier. But there were frescoes on the walls, antique candelabra, and the Rialto market with its fresh produce was a stroll away.
Each afternoon gondolas would glide down our picturesque little canal with camera-snapping tourists who had no hesitation including us in their pictures. Did they envy us sitting up there with our tumblers of table wine from a hole-in-the-wall shop around the corner where staff filled our empty one-litre water bottles from a wooden barrel for two euros? We didn't care. We got more of a thrill out of saying buongiorno to the guys who manoeuvred their small barges down the same canal to collect our rubbish twice a week.
Ironically, it was participating in the routines and rituals of everyday life ‚Äì taking the rubbish out, shopping in the markets and cooking, the very things we usually go on holiday to avoid ‚Äì that gave us the biggest kick. They afforded us an insight into local life that you don't get as tourists. We were hooked.
We spent a summer in Milan in an flat overlooking the Naviglio Grande canal ‚Äì an arty neighbourhood quiet until after dark, when intrepid foodies descended on the local aperitivo bars and trattorias. That was fine, because we were the ones living there, participating in the locals' early evening sipping and snacking ritual every single day. As in Venice, we took our cues from the little old ladies pulling their vinyl shopping trollies when it came to deciding which specialist vendors to frequent and what produce to buy. And it delighted us no end that our favourite cheese-seller took pride in teaching us how to order in Italian, little by little, each day.
Another year we stayed in a trullo, a whitewashed, conical house among olive groves just outside Alberobello in Puglia. Our caretaker, Maria, would turn up unannounced to hang a bunch of semi-dried tomatoes from the ceiling of our charming little kitchen or show us how to stoke the wood-fired oven attached to the home. One day she brought a wooden board, a rolling pin and a colossal bag of flour and taught us how to make fresh pasta and pizza. We insisted she call her family to come over and we all feasted together by candlelight next to the pizza oven.
But it was our last summer in Venice that was the most memorable. We finally graduated to a sprawling palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal ‚Äì even if the mezzanine-level bedroom looked like it had been added in the 1970s, the crockery was of the same era, and the wallpaper was peeling. We stocked the fridge with prosecco, Aperol and Campari, and established our own ritual. Each evening we stood at our window ‚Äì no, we still didn't have a terrace ‚Äì and sipped our homemade spritz while watching the vaporetto cruise by. And we sighed.

NASA/JPL-Caltech/GSSR. The pair will come their closest at 4:59 pm ET today.
An asteroid is sailing past Earth today, and it's bringing along some luggage.

At 4:59 pm ET, asteroid 1998 QE2 will be a mere 3.6 million miles away from our home planet. And it's not alone. It is bringing with it a moon that orbits it as it flies along its own path.
Okay, "mere" is an exaggeration. It will come to about a distance that's 15 times the distance between the Earth and the moon. The asteroid is not a threat to Earth, NASA says.
Astronomers first discovered 1998 QE2 in 1998, hence its name. They only discovered that it had an orbiting moon on May 29, however, when radar images showed the moon as a smudge by its side. Among asteroids near Earth, only 16 percent that are 200 meters (655 feet) in diameter or larger are made up of two or three pieces that travel in tandem, called binary or triple asteroids. The new radar images suggest 1998 QE2 is 1.7 miles in diameter. Its moon is 2,000 feet wide.

The pair will not get this close to Earth again for another 200 years.
Over the next week, astronomers using the Deep Space Network antenna in Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico will observe 1998 QE2 as it comes by. Radar helps astronomers discern asteroids' shapes, rotation, surface features and orbits. Such observations are a part of NASA's larger effort to learn about asteroids so it can predict when any do threaten Earth--although, of course, we're not always the greatest at that quite yet.

Vincenzo Santarsiero, 78, made the journey in 1970, and&nbsp;began working locally as a carpenter ‚Äì as well as tending an&nbsp;allotment on a site known as Farm Terrace. According to his daughter, Rosangela, this was not a matter of recreation: her father could not read or write, and was limited in his job prospects ‚Äì so growing his own fruit and vegetables was an essential means of feeding his family.
Vincenzo is still there, and these days&nbsp;the two of them see to three plots. They grow an amazing variety of stuff: white and black figs, cherries, apples, artichokes and Italian crops such as cicerchie, a variety of chickpea. The soil here, they tell me, is beyond compare, thanks to the fact that the allotments ‚Äì first opened in 1896 ‚Äì are on the site of a&nbsp;former sewage works.
There are around 60 working plots on&nbsp;the Farm Terrace site, which is overlooked by Watford general hospital, and mere yards from the home of Watford FC. Now, in partnership with the corporate developer the Kier Group in a financial arrangement called a "local asset-backed vehicle", Watford borough council ‚Äì led by its elected Lib Dem mayor ‚Äì wants to clear land it claims is&nbsp;worth ¬£7m and make way for a new "health campus". As far as the allotment holders understand it, two-fifths of the development will be set aside for a new extension to the hospital, though when that might materialise is unclear. The rest will be given over to development they expect will be completed much more quickly, and which seems to have little connection to health at all: houses, along with "business incubator and retail units", a hotel, restaurants, cafes and "urban public piazzas" ‚Äì all mouthwateringly close to the M25.
On 14 May approval for the land's change of use ‚Äì a legal requirement if allotments are going to be concreted over ‚Äì was granted by the communities secretary, Eric Pickles. As a result, the campaigners' only hope is to have his decision overturned by judicial review. If they lose, they will be offered new space on other sites, where many gardeners claim the quality of the soil is&nbsp;hugely inferior ‚Äì and in any case, creating new plots will be a huge job. Certainly, Vincenzo Santasiero is not interested: "If I have to start again from&nbsp;scratch ‚Äì no way," he says, with no&nbsp;little disdain.
Rising tensions between the council and the Farm Terrace gardeners are reflected in a tangle of claims and counter-claims. The allotment holders say the new plots are mostly over two miles away; the council says the extra distance people will have to travel will be&nbsp;no more than a mile. The council emphasises the need for the hospital extension, new housing and jobs, and assures local gardeners it has "agreed to&nbsp;invest an additional ¬£800,000 for improvements to our allotment sites"; the plot holders say they have no confidence this money will materialise. They also point to an earlier plan for the "health campus" that left their allotments intact, but the council say the recession has changed things, and "the delivery of any major, long-term, mixed use scheme ‚Ä¶ [is] more complex and potentially more financially precarious".
Among the most vocal of the Farm Terrace gardeners is Sara Jane Trebar, a&nbsp;40-year-old full-time mum who has had a plot here for five years, and whose specialities include raspberries and parsnips. "Emotionally, it's been very hard," she says. "The thing is, how could you recreate somewhere like this? And I'm worried about the detrimental effect that getting rid of these plots will have on people's health. For a lot of us, this is physical work ‚Äì but there's also the emotional release you get." Plenty of research backs this up: eight years ago, a University of Loughborough study found that regular gardening had a clearly positive effect on the "physical and mental health, wellbeing and social&nbsp;skills" of vulnerable adults; more recently, work done at the University of Exeter found that urban horticulturists had relatively low levels of "psychological distress" and high ratings for "life satisfaction".
The basic outlines of the Farm Terrace story are increasingly common, all over the country. Allotments are in demand, thanks to revived interest in fruit and vegetable growing, and the thrifty culture embedded in the long aftermath of the financial crash. But the selfsame economic conditions seem to be leading councils to look at their land holdings, and put up some for redevelopment.
In March this year, the National Society of Allotment and Leisure Gardeners claimed that whereas it once received enquiries about threats to allotments at the rate of around one a week, the frequency had since increased to a call&nbsp;a&nbsp;day. In 2012, one of their surveys revealed that the greatest worry for 74% of allotment holders was the selling off&nbsp;of their plots. There is, perhaps, something about traditional allotments that sits awkwardly with modern local government, the British model of capitalism, and the ties that bind the two ‚Äì as proved by one particular story which peaked six years ago, when 83 people were evicted from the century-old Manor Farm allotments in East London as part of preparations for the 2012 Olympics, making way for what one campaigner called a "four-week concrete pathway".
There are around 300,000 allotments in the UK, and more than 100,000 people whose names are on waiting lists. Two years ago, Eric Pickles' department floated plans to relieve local&nbsp;authorities of their obligations to&nbsp;provide "sufficient" allotments, something enshrined in the Small Holdings and Allotments Act of 1908, a remarkably benevolent bit of legislation which belatedly responded to the huge population shift to towns and cities, and was coloured by the early-20th century's concerns about ordinary folks pursuing wholesome interests rather than drinking their lives away.
There was a huge backlash against the&nbsp;Pickles plan, and the proposals were&nbsp;binned. But as allotment-centred controversies around the country prove, there are still mounting problems. In response, a new campaign has sprung up in Brighton, called Don't Lose the Plot. Its initial spark, in 2012, was an attempt by Brighton and Hove city council ‚Äì run by the Green party, weirdly enough ‚Äì to put up rents by 70%. "A lot of us had voted Green imagining that allotments would be high up the agenda, and protected," says Mark Carroll, 45, one of&nbsp;the campaign's organisers. With the&nbsp;help of other political parties, the proposal was beaten, but the campaign has continued, focusing on allotment closures (Carroll mentions ongoing cases in North Yorkshire, Cheshire, Surrey and Essex), rising rents and drastic changes to the size of plots.
"Across the country, councils are trying to shirk their responsibilities by&nbsp;using loopholes in the law," he says. For around 300 years, he explains, the British allotment has been a "10-rod plot", a reference to an imperial measurement that amounts to approximately 250 sq m ‚Äì but there is no specification in law of any minimum size. About 10&nbsp;years ago, demand for allotments suddenly jumped, "part of a greater move for people to get back to the land&nbsp;and grow their own food", Carroll reckons. And for the last four years, Brighton council has only allowed new gardeners five-rod plots, meaning that around half the city's allotments are now 50% of their old size.
There are 1,738 people in the city waiting for an allotment. For some, a&nbsp;half-plot is sufficient, but Carrol insists that the council is comparatively land-rich, and that gardeners should have a&nbsp;choice. "If you're trying to grow vegetables to get any degree of self-sufficiency, a half-plot isn't even for your potatoes," he says. "Crop rotation is a non-starter, too. And when you chop a plot in half, you get two sheds, so you lose growing land."
In increasingly crammed allotment sites, Carroll says there is also increasing tension between longstanding gardeners, some of whom have more than one plot, and newcomers whose growing space is that bit smaller. This, perhaps, is one of the factors behind occasional stories about allotments boiling over with bitter disputes, and accusations of&nbsp;harassment and bullying.
"We get posts on our Facebook page saying people are greedy for having a full plot," he tells me. "There are a lot more border disputes happening, with people snatching a bit here and there because they haven't got enough. And it's basically because the council's answer to the waiting list problem wasn't, 'Let's look into opening more sites' but, 'Let's chop them all in half.'"
When I arrive at Barnett Wood Lane allotments in Leatherhead, the first person I meet is 73 year-old Frank Lynes, a sometime professional gardener who has had a plot here for 23&nbsp;years. Inside five minutes, I realise he is the brother of Roy Lynes, an original member of the rock greats Status Quo. Rather than discussing such frippery, though, Lynes ‚Äì along with at least 15 other allotment holders ‚Äì has met me to talk about an increasingly heated local story: Mole Valley borough council's plans to hand the site to a developer. By&nbsp;a strange quirk, they are doing so in&nbsp;partnership with Merton College, Oxford, which owns land close by. Lynes has a map of what's being proposed, which lays out in primary colours what makes the site so enticing: like Farm Terrace in Watford, only more so, it is right next to the M25.
Most of the people I meet are retired, though there are plots here used by much younger gardeners. The Leatherhead Youth Project has an allotment used by people at risk of exclusion from school, some of whom will eventually get a qualification in horticulture. Another plot is used by a charity called LeatherHead Start, which works with homeless people. There is also a smattering of people who started their lives some way away: 34-year-old Sait Buyukertas, for example, is a Turkish Kurd who works as a chef, and says his&nbsp;plot is one of the few places that reminds him of his rural background (he&nbsp;specialises in chickpeas, which apparently taste immeasurably better than either the tinned or dried variety).
The site has been given over the allotments since 1865, when local landowners bequeathed it for use by the&nbsp;local poor. The gardeners here first heard that there were proposals for the site in February. Four developers are apparently interested in building on it: there are local rumours that a distribution centre might be among the plans, though the most commonly mentioned possibilities are "retail and housing".
The council proposes to move the allotment holders to a site right next to&nbsp;the motorway, mention of which prompts a familiar chorus. "It's rotten soil," says Chris Street, 74, a retired industrial chemist.
"I've spoken to somebody who's a farmer, who once thought about taking that site over," says Jenny Day, 66, a&nbsp;former accountant. "And he said, 'No&nbsp;way. I looked at it, and you couldn't grow anything.' There's horrible tufted grass, and where any track has been it's horribly waterlogged." There is also mention of noise and air pollution, inadequate sunlight, the isolation of the land, and two words that will cause any gardener a pang of fear: "heavy clay" (the council insists that any developer will have to work to bring any new allotment site "up to a better or equal standard" to the one that might be built over).
None of the gardeners are sure how the borough council got their name on the deeds to the land, and the people here say that they are having extreme difficulty accessing the relevant documents via freedom of information requests. John Weller, 77, tells me that the site is the only bit of land to which the council can lay claim that isn't in the green belt, which makes it all the more appealing. Local councillors, he says, have talked not just about houses ‚Äì which, say the allotment-holders, could just as easily be built in local brownfield sites ‚Äì but also a new hotel and cinema.
When I contact the council, I get an emailed statement from a Tory councillor named Charles Yarwood, who's in charge of Mole Valley's communities and assets portfolio. "It would be remiss&nbsp;of Mole Valley district council if&nbsp;we did not explore the opportunity to&nbsp;market a site which we own and to assess its full potential," it says. The text goes on: "Any such development will provide MVDC with an ongoing financial contribution which could help protect existing services, add a measure of certainty to the council's finances and ensure the council can continue to provide value for money to its residents."
Back at the allotments, all of that is phrased in slightly more blunt language, as proved by a massed answer to a simple question: what do the plot-holders think is driving the plans?
"Money!" says one voice.
"Always money," confirms another.
"Money, money, money," says yet&nbsp;another, and the sound of truly mirthless laughter echoes around the&nbsp;greenhouses and sheds.AllotmentsLocal governmentGardensFood &amp; drinkLand rightsHealth &amp; wellbeing

I stayed at Lake Baikal for the first time in 2003. Walking along the shore, I&nbsp;discovered cabins at regular intervals, inhabited by strangely happy recluses. Five years later I chanced to spend three days with a ranger in a tiny izba, a traditional Russian log cabin, on the eastern shore of&nbsp;the lake. At night we sipped vodka and played chess; during the day I helped him haul in his fishing nets. We hardly spoke, but we read a lot. That was when I&nbsp;promised myself I would live alone in a&nbsp;cabin for a few months before I turned 40.
So, two years ago, I left my home in Paris and spent six months in a little hut on the Lake's western shore, very far from civilisation: it was six days' walk to the nearest village, a day from the nearest neighbour, and there were no access roads.
I wanted to experiment with the simple life and claim back time. I wanted to feel life, and understand how it would look just contemplating the landscape, rather than harvesting kilometres on the road as I was used to when travelling. I have done many great adventures (crossing the Himalayas on foot in 1997, walking the route the gulag escapees took, from Yakutsk in Siberia to Calcutta, in 2003). But it became a disease I wanted to cure.
Lake Baikal is 395 miles long, 49&nbsp;miles wide, 1,642m (just over a mile) deep, and 25 million years old. I arrived in February, when temperatures drop to -30C and the ice is over a metre thick. I was driven across it in a truck.
Constructed in the 1980s as a geologist's hut, my cabin lay in a clearing of cedar forest in the northern sector of the Baikal-Lena nature reserve. The owners, Volodya T, a 50-year-old forest ranger and his wife Ludmilla, had lived there for 15 years, but they wanted to move to Irkutsk. Other rangers were spaced about 19&nbsp;miles apart through the reserve.
The cabin had its back to the mountains, at the foot of a slope 1,981m high, surrounded by coniferous taiga and with views of the lake. Snow had meringued the roof; the beams were the colour of gingerbread. It measured nine square metres and was heated by a noisy cast-iron stove. I could put up with the snoring of this particular companion. I had two windows: through one, looking east, I could see the snowy crests of Buryatia, 60 miles away. The winter forest was a silvery fur tossed onto the shoulders of the terrain.
I took a lot of equipment with me: axe and cleaver, fishing poles, kerosene lamp, ice drill, saw, snowshoes, tent, liquor glasses and vodka, cigars, provisions (pasta, rice, Tabasco sauce, coffee) and a library of almost 80 books.
You can't predict the mood you will be in six months later, so I had planned my library carefully. It would be an easy mistake to choose only difficult reading, and think you would only need high-minded, philosophical, idealistic writing. Then after 10 days you want to kill your book and read a detective novel.
I chose a wide range of philosophy, poetry, literature, nature books. Michel D√©on for melancholy, DH Lawrence for sensuality, some philosophers (Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, the Stoics), Sade and Casanova to stir my blood. Some books on life in the woods: Daniel Defoe for myth, Grey Owl for his radical stance, Aldo Leopold for ethics. In some respects the whole experience was to put a library in the woods.
If I had not had books, I would have gone quickly mad. A book is a way to have someone with you. For the first time in my life I was able to read a whole book, beginning to end without stopping, sometimes reading for eight hours straight.
I cut my day into two parts. In the morning I did spiritual things: reading, writing, smoking, learning poetry, looking out of the window. In the afternoon I was more physical: digging a hole in the ice, fishing, running around my little kingdom in snowshoes, cutting firewood.
By restricting the panoply of actions, one goes deeper into each experience. The castaway enjoys absolute freedom ‚Äì but within the limits of his island.
People who live in cabins can quickly fall into a state of depression, of cabin fever. Because you don't see anyone, you can spend your life lying in bed drinking vodka and nobody will say anything to you. So it's important to organise your time with activity, like the monks did, or Robinson Crusoe, who dressed for dinner every night though he was shipwrecked and alone. The way to stay smart is to behave when you are alone as you would surrounded by people in the city.
What was pleasant about this life was the repetition of acts. Each day goes by, a mirror of the one before, a rough draft of the one to come. You can find happiness in the possibility of things, but you can also find it in knowing exactly what will happen. It is peaceful, a very slow life, but you become rich.
I have a lot of vitality and need to do sports, so I went out and walked every day, climbed the hills around the cabin, and occasionally took a tent and hiked into the wilderness to bivouac in the woods. And to go ice skating on this frozen lake was amazing.
I also relied on a few goods from civilisation for pleasure: including vodka and cigars. I liked the idea of living in a very huge remote place but with some real luxury goods. Then you balance your life, moving between the two contrasting experiences, archaic and luxurious. After a day's walking in the snow and fishing at -30C, it is wonderful to read Chinese poetry while smoking a Havana.
Though I lived alone, it was not real solitude. For real hermitude you are alone for years and years. For me it was a relative thing.
Though I lived alone, it was not real solitude. For real hermitude you are alone for years and years. For me it was a relative thing.
I sometimes visited those who lived nearest, and I often had visitors ‚Äì people I knew, sometimes strangers who happened to be crossing the lake. It wasn't too painful for me as they would only stay for a couple of hours, and it would interrupt the loneliness. And anyway, I didn't want to live a very extreme, challenging, difficult life. It was just an experience.
Through Sergei and Natasha, a couple who ran the weather station 31 miles from the cabin, I met Sasha and Yura, two Siberian fishermen. They were archetypal Russians, very strong, very big, speaking loudly, drinking a lot, very generous people with a lot of energy, who hadn't cut their link with the wilderness. If you put those people in the city they would be like an elephant.
These people have a rustic life, an intense and important life. They enjoy it, though they are perfectly aware that it has negative and positive aspects. Life is physically difficult. It is hard to live in a forest in the cold. When you are 50 you look 70 years old. But for sure they would not change it for a life in the city. They know that they would lose their freedom there. Better to live joyfully in a wilderness clearing than languish in a city.
Milan Kundera said because Russia didn't have an elite in its history, and no Renaissance, Russians are still in a state of irrationality and magical thinking, like the Middle Ages. I found that with these kind of people. They don't say superficial things, only wise things. They are not blah-blah-blah people, like me. It was good not to have to keep a conversation going. Why is life with others so hard? Because you always have to find something to say. I thought of those days of walking around Paris nervously tossing off "Just-fine-thank-yous" and "Let's-get-together-soons" to people I didn't really know, who babbled the same things to me, as if in a panic.
It's incredible how much mankind hogs its own attention. The presence of others makes the world fade out. Solitude is the reconquest of the enjoyment of things. The only way to be free is to be alone. You still have laws, of nature, your own discipline, but the beginning of coercion, compromise, imprisonment begins with just one other person.
Boredom didn't frighten me. There are worse pangs: the sorrow of not sharing with a loved one the beauty of lived moments. Solitude: what others miss out on by not being with the person who experiences it.
I was warned before I left Paris that boredom would be my deadly enemy. I'd die of it! I'd listened politely. People who said such things assumed they themselves were superb entertainment. "Reduced to myself alone, I feed myself, it is true, on my own substance, but it is not exhausted," writes Jean-Jacques Rousseau in the Reveries of a Solitary Walker.
In April I was given two dogs, Aika and Bek, who helped combat loneliness, and would bark if a bear came near, from the end of May when they came out of hibernation.
When the ice broke on 22 May, it happened suddenly: there was a storm and the ice shattered. I have never seen such power. It was like the elements were making war. In the west we talk about the beginning of spring, of entering spring. In Siberia there was no entering, no transition; it was rapid. In 10 minutes winter was defeated.
That month I sat at my table watching the ice die. Water seeped in everywhere, mottling the surface with black blotches. Then ducks who had been living it up down south landed in the open areas, eager for love and fresh water. Eagles soared, geese patrolled in gangs, gulls did nosedives, butterflies, amazed at being alive, staggered through the air.
Immersion in the Taiga was satisfying because I felt a belonging to nature. Unlike when you are crossing mountains, when you feel like a stranger on the edge, staying in one place makes you feel part of the forest, just like the bear, or a fish, or a bird.
The month of June, when the animals need their vigour for love, presents a problem in the cycle of life: how to bridge the gap between the awakening of May and the abundance of July? Nature has come up with ‚Ä¶ flies. By July, the air was loaded with bugs.
On 28 July I bade farewell to the lake. I went there not knowing whether I'd find the strength to stay; I&nbsp;left knowing I would return. I often lay in my hammock in the broiling sun. In my kayak I paddled onto the lake, as slick as oil, the reflection so pure you could misread which half of the mirror image was which. On Bastille Day, two friends were visiting from France, and we raised a flag on the beach and downed three vodka eye-openers.
A retreat is a revolt. In the outposts of Baikal the authority of Moscow holds hardly any sway. The urban liberal, leftist, revolutionary and upper-middle-class citizens all pay money for bread, gas and taxes. The hermit asks nothing from the state and gives nothing to the state. He disappears into the woods and thrives there. His retreat constitutes a loss of income for the government. Becoming a loss of income should be the objective of true revolutionaries.
I&nbsp;couldn't live permanently in the cabin. But I have been back to the taiga a couple of times, and I know I will experience again an act of hermitism, maybe for longer. I discovered the Algerian desert a few years ago, and I think the desert is a good place to do this: taiga without the trees.
I am still wandering, but I am not so obsessed with travelling. My experience made me understand that the best way to stop feeling that time is fleeing is just to sit somewhere for a while. I discovered that living within silence is rejuvenating. That the parade of hours is busier than the ploughing-through of miles. That the eye never tires of splendour.
I'm sure more people today will want to do what I did. I think an increasing number will need, at some time, to cut themselves off and escape modern life, then come back later to a more simple life. What I did was a radical acceleration of that. But the return to the forest, you can do it in your own home. Time is the most precious treasure we have. We all have 24 hours a day, but we are all destroying this treasure, especially with electronics. Always being contactable is the beginning of your loss of freedom. It is what we ask of prisoners ; it's like an electronic tag. There is always the intrusion of people into your time and it is horrible.
The first act is to throw out your mobile phone. Try to spend three hours in the same action, in the same consultation of time ‚Äì writing, reading, doing some action.
Russians know that the taiga is there if things go wrong. It's good to know that out there, in a forest in the world, there is a cabin where something is possible, something close to the sheer happiness of being alive. So, refuseniks of every country, take to the woods! Consolation awaits you there.

Last week, 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura became the oldest person to climb Mount Everest. Amazing, but other people weren't so lucky. As of 2012, an estimated 235 people have died on the mountain.

This infographic, from designer Ed Hernandez, breaks down what happened to them. Some of the causes of death are what you might expect--an avalanche or unexpected fall are the top two causes--but others are more surprising: altitude sickness accounted for nine deaths, while cerebral oedemas--fluid buildup in the brain that happens at high altitudes--killed five people.

Most of the climbers died while climbing back down the mountain, usually in the "Death Zone," which is 8,000 meters up (the mountain itself is 8,850 meters tall) and lethally combines blistering cold, low oxygen, and high elevation.

The infographic calls Everest "the highest graveyard on planet earth." No kidding.

That's what one analyst has claimed.
In an exhaustive 6,500-word article on the financial website Seeking Alpha, analyst Nathan Weiss lays out a case that the Model S actually has higher effective emissions than most large SUVs of both the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and smog-producing pollutants like sulfur dioxide.
As a 2013 Tesla Model S owner, I was shocked and concerned by his claims.
Although carbon emissions were not a big factor in my decision to buy a plug-in car--I was more interested in performance, style, and low operating cost--the car's green cred was a nice bonus.
Now here's this Weiss guy, calling me a global-warming villain.
But I couldn't help but notice that in his role as financial analyst, Weiss had been advising his clients to "short" the stock of Tesla Motors [NSDQ:TSLA]--to bet against it. (Tesla stock price down = happy clients; Tesla stock up = very unhappy clients.)
And is it a coincidence that the article appeared the same day Tesla stock skyrocketed 30 percent, after Tesla's first-quarter earning report? (It's since risen another 30 percent.)
Weiss's motives aside, his claims deserve a close look on their merits.
Not only the tailpipe.
Like all 100-percent electric cars, the Model S indisputably has zero tailpipe emissions.
But Weiss looks at emissions from the powerplants that supply the Tesla's electric "fuel," as well as the excess electricity consumed by the Model S due to charging inefficiencies and "vampire" losses.
These two factors, he concludes, give the Model S effective carbon emissions roughly equal to those of a Honda Accord.
Throw in the carbon emitted during production of the Model S's 85-kWh lithium-ion battery, says Weiss, and the Model S ends up in Ford Expedition territory.
Not so fast....
Although Weiss makes a number of valid points, I see several flaws in his argument. And he bases his carbon-footprint estimates of battery production on a single report that is far out of sync with previous research on the subject. More From Green Car Reports:

Tesla Didn't Make A Profit On Its Cars In Q1: Let's Be Clear.

Will Solar Panels Destroy Electric Utilities' Business Model? Yes, They Say.
Furthermore, he fails to account for the carbon emissions resulting from the production of gasoline. If the carbon footprint of a Tesla's fuel counts against it, why shouldn't a standard car's fuel be subject to similar accounting?
So let's go through his analysis and his conclusions point by point.
*Power plant emissions count against electric cars.
Virtually all electric car advocate agree that when toting up the environmental pros and cons of electric cars, it's only fair to include powerplant emissions.
When this has been done previously, the numbers have still favored electric cars. The Union of Concerned Scientists, for example, concluded in a 2012 report, "Electric vehicles charged on the power grid have lower global warming emissions than the average gasoline-based vehicle sold today."
The carbon-friendliness of the electric grid, of course, varies wildly from region to region, depending upon the type of powerplants there.

Tesla Motors has an interactive calculator on its website that allows you to calculate the effective carbon emissions of your Model S, depending on your particular state's powerplant mix (coal, gas, nuclear, hydro, etc.). The numbers range from 26 gm/mi in Idaho (mostly hydro) to 310 gm/mi in West Virginia (mostly coal).
According to Weiss, the national average for Tesla's claimed Model S CO2 emissions works out to 163 gm/mile. Tesla says the corresponding figure for gas cars is 400 gm/mi.
Although not truly zero-emission, electric cars in general (and the Model S in particular) are still better than most gas cars. Or so goes the mainstream scientific thinking.
Weiss begs to differ.
*Tesla's numbers are too optimistic.
According to the Tesla website, it assumes a Model S electricity usage of 283 Watt-hours per mile for its CO2 calculations. That's the power required to drive at a steady 55 mph.
Weiss disputes that number as unrealistically low. He cites, among other sources, the EPA's number of 321 Wh/mi, as well as 48 reports on the Tesla owners' forum that averaged to 367 Wh/mi.
He concludes that the real-world power consumption of the 85-kWh Model S is actually more like 375 Wh/mi. That's 33 percent higher than Tesla claims.
Accordingly, CO2 emissions would also be 33 percent higher.
I can't argue with Weiss on this one. In 3,000 miles of driving my 60-kWh Model S, I've averaged 343 Wh/mi. Since my 60-kWh car is about 7 percent more efficient than the heavier 85-kWh model, that would correspond to a real-world consumption of 367 Wh/mi for the longer-range car.
Because my driving--as well as that of the 48 Tesla owners Weiss cites--has occurred mostly in winter, I would expect average energy usage to decline as the weather warms. (I've already seen my efficiency improve in May.) I'd guesstimate a real-world year-round number for the 85-kWh Model S of 340 Wh/mi.
But I won't quibble with Weiss's figure of 375.
So a 33-percent bump raises Tesla's claimed Model S effective carbon emissions of 163 gm/mi to 216 gm/mi, or about the same as the Toyota Prius V.
*Charging losses boost carbon emissions by 18 percent.
Not every kilowatt-hour of energy that comes out of the wall plug ends up in the Model S battery. Citing EPA figures and reports from owners, Weiss estimates the Model S's real-world charging efficiency at about 85 percent.
Again, Weiss has a good point. I've measured charging losses of 10-15 percent in my own car. Tesla quotes a "peak charging efficiency" of 92 percent on its website. An average charging efficiency of 85 percent seems plausible.
That means a Model S typically draws 17 percent more power from the plug than it uses to power the car.
So now our Model S carbon emissions are up to 254 gm/mi, slightly less than those of a 2013 Honda Civic.
*Vampire losses further raise emissions by 55 percent.
Whoa! This is truly a shocking claim. It implies that vampire losses--the power used by the Model S when it's off, just sitting there in your garage--amount to nearly as much as Tesla claims the car uses while driving.
Weiss, citing a number of sources, (including my own report on Model S vampire losses on this site), settles on a number for vampire losses of 5.1 kWh per day. He then combines that figure with an estimate of 7,728 miles driven per year to conclude that vampire-related Model S CO2 emissions amount to 140 gm/mi.
This brings his new total up to to 394 gm/mile, about the same as a BMW 5-Series.
I'd call Weiss's number for vampire drain a bit high, but not implausible. I measured at-the-wall vampire losses averaging 4.5 kWh per day on my car.
One reason for Weiss's high-ball estimate may be his apparent misunderstanding of the Model S battery thermal management system. He claims that vampire losses in the 30-to-50-degree range are nearly triple those occurring at temperaturess of 50 to 80 degrees, due to the extra juice required to keep the battery warm.
This is simply wrong. I have noticed no such variations.
And a Tesla rep confirmed to me that the Model S battery is not temperature-controlled when the car sits idle, so there is no battery heating/cooling power draw. (Elon Musk has publicly confirmed this.) The brief pre-heat/cool prior to the once-a-day "topping off" charge cycle would have only a minimal impact on vampire losses.
I also take issue with Weiss's estimate of the Model S average yearly driving distance of only 7,728 miles. (His derivation of the number is too lengthy to analyze here.)

How could it be that Model S owners drive barely half as much as the national average of 13,476 miles per year? l know my own driving mileage has actually increased since I got my Model S, simply because the car is such a blast to drive.
It's only temporary.
But Weiss's major miscue in the section about vampire power drain--other than misspelling my name--is his implication that these daily losses are a permanent long-term condition.
Tesla has in fact been working on "sleep mode" software improvements to reduce vampire losses. Its next major update, due this summer, is expected to cut vampire losses by half.
By the end of the year, they will be virtually eliminated, according to Tesla spokesperson Shanna Hendricks.
Weiss acknowledges the promised sleep mode, but doubts that it will make any difference. "History (and the mechanics of the battery) suggest it will not meaningfully reduce idle power consumption," he writes.
I suggest it will. And that by the end of the year, 55 percent of Weiss's argument will have gone up in smoke.
Anticipating the new sleep mode, I'm going to ignore vampire losses and stick with 254 gm/mi as the Model S carbon footprint, compared to Weiss's vampire-bloated number of 394 gm/mi.
*Battery production adds 39 percent more.
The manufacture of a car contributes to its lifetime carbon emissions. And it's well established that the manufacture of lithium-ion batteries is a carbon-intensive process. The question is, how much?
For his battery-production carbon numbers, Weiss relies primarily on an outlier study from the Journal of Industrial Ecology. Its estimates of carbon footprint from lithium-ion battery production are far higher than previous studies, and it has been pilloried in the blogosphere for numerous errors too arcane to enumerate here.
A 2010 study in the journal of the American Chemical Society, on the other hand, concludes that the environmental impact of the battery is "relatively small." It estimates that battery production adds about 15 percent to the driving emissions of an electric car.
A 2012 study for the California Air Resources Board puts the number at 26 percent, assuming the California powerplant mix. But if you adjust to the dirtier national U.S. grid powerplant mix, driving emissions go up. So the percentage share of battery production goes down, also to about 15 percent.
Tesla may, in fact, beat even those lower numbers. Uniquely among electric car manufacturers, Tesla uses what are arguably the most efficiently manufactured lithium-ion battery cells on the planet: "commodity" 18650 laptop cells, which Panasonic churns out by the billions in highly automated plants. (I'm unaware of any carbon life-cycle analysis for these batteries.)
We'll go with the consensus mainstream number of 15 percent, which brings total Model S carbon emissions up to 292 gm/mi, against Weiss's battery-boosted grand total of 547 gm/mi.
Carbon summary.
We've arrived at a number for the real-world effective CO2 emissions of a Model S of 292 g/mi. Admittedly, that's lot higher than Tesla claims on its website.
But worse than a Grand Cherokee? Hardly.
The V-6 Grand Cherokee's official EPA CO2 number is 479 g/mi when fitted with the smallest engine offered, a 3.6-liter V-6. The more powerful V-8 model logs in at a whopping 592 g/mi.
Oops...
In a follow-up post a few days later, Weiss backed off and significantly downgraded his estimate for Model S carbon emissions.
He concedes that, in calculating vampire losses per mile, total distance of 12,000 miles per year makes for a better comparison. He also downgrades his estimate of idle power losses to 3.5 kWh per day.
And, strangely, he neglects to account for the carbon footprint of battery production in any way.

With these new numbers, he recalculates the Tesla's total effective carbon emissions to be 346 g/mi, not a lot more than the 292 g/mi I calculated above.
Weiss also downgrades his SUV bogeyman, pointing out that even at his revised lower figure of 346 g/mi, the Model S is still a worse carbon polluter than the Toyota Highlander, which the EPA rates at 312 g/mi.
What about carbon from gasoline production?
But for all his zeal in exhaustively parsing the carbon footprint of electricity production, Weiss conveniently forgets to mention that producing gasoline also has its own carbon footprint.
According to a 2000 report from the MIT Energy Lab, gasoline production accounts for 19 percent of the total lifetime CO2 emissions of a typical car. Actually driving the car accounts for about 75 percent of its lifetime carbon output.
Thus the carbon footprint of fuel production adds about 25 percent to a gas car's nominal CO2 emissions number.
Sorry, Mr. Weiss. If you apply the same rules to gasoline cars that you did to the Tesla, your Toyota Highlander just went from 312 g/mi to 390 g/mi.
On this adjusted apples-to-apples basis, the Tesla figure of 292 g/mi is roughly comparable to that of the Scion iQ.
*Other pollutants.
With all the growing concern about global warming and carbon emissions, old-fashioned "smog" air pollution--primarily nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2)--has receded into the background.
Due to strict emissions laws, modern gasoline cars emit very little of these lung-threatening pollutants. The same cannot be said, unfortunately, about coal-fired powerplants.
Weiss calculates that powerplant emissions give the Model S an effective level of NOx pollution about triple that of the EPA limit for gas cars. (I'm discounting his suspect inclusion of vampire losses.)
The situation for sulfur dioxide is much worse. Weiss calculates that effective Model S sulfur dioxide emissions equal that of about 400 gas cars. (Again, the suspect vampire data is discounted.)
Weiss writes, "In many states, including California, if a smog-testing center could measure the effective emissions of a Tesla Model S through a tailpipe, the owner would face fines, penalties, or the sale of the vehicle under state 'clunker buyback' programs."
In terms of sulfur dioxide, gas cars are so clean and coal-fired electricity so dirty that a 60-watt light bulb effectively emits as much sulfur dioxide as an average gasoline car driving at 60 mph.
Frankly, I can't argue with these disturbing numbers, and I have not seen them refuted anywhere. But they say more about the tough emission laws for gas cars and the remarkably lax rules for coal-fired powerplants belching sulfur dioxide than they do about the Model S.
Nevertheless, I'm feeling a bit guilty about the sulfur dioxide spewing out of my Tesla's virtual tailpipe.
At least I live in New York state, which uses coal for only about 10 percent of its power production. That's about one quarter of the U.S nationwide percentage, so presumably I'm "only" 100 times worse than a gas car when it comes to sulfur dioxide emissions.
Fortunately, I'm not alone; the vast majority of electric cars operate in states with low-coal grids like California, Washington, and New York.
And the grid is slowly getting cleaner. As more wind, solar, and natural gas come online and antiquated coal plants are shut down, my effective SO2 emissions will steadily decline.
So in the end...
After all of this, the conclusion seemed clear: I drive a kick-ass, high-performance, five-seat all-electric luxury sport sedan that has the same wells-to-wheels carbon emissions as a tiny Scion minicar with two real seats.
Anybody got a problem with that?
When it comes to virtual tailpipe emissions, carbon and otherwise, the Model S ain't perfect.
But if you ask me, it's a huge step in the right direction.
